            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur Lordship is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of my late severe Dispensation, how I lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:199330:4"/> the fury and triumphs of a Chronical Distemper, by which I was brought to the brink of the Grave, and the confines of the House of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and silence, and every Toll of our Bell was a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proclamation to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of my Translation to another State: but Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God was pleased to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe kindness (as sometime to <hi>Epaphroditus</hi>) by a strange and almost miraculous Recovery. Hereupon I resolved, to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Gratitude, to the Glory of my Preserver, who <hi>kept my Soul in life and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not my feet to be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:199330:4"/>
            <p>Now seeing, my Lord, we have the best and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Religion, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a Profession every way both amiable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous; yet (such is the loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sensuality of the Times) that many either A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistically deny the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Christianity, or suffer themselves to be drawn away and removed from the Hope of the Gospel, by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Allurements and gross Delusions. I concluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (considering the Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism and Apostasie of this Age) I could not do a piece of more acceptable Service to
<pb facs="tcp:199330:5"/> the Lord Jesus, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade those who have solemnly engaged themselves in this holy Religion, to observe their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Vows and Obligations, and maintain the Doctrine of Faith <hi>once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Levite in the Book of <hi>Judges</hi> saw his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine abused to death, he cut her in pieces, and sent her amongst the Tribes of Israel: so seeing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts &amp; defamations passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion, &amp; the cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of Atheists, Romanists, and Enthusiasts, either to make us wholly renounce our espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Evangelical Verities, or else
<pb facs="tcp:199330:5"/> to imbibe impure Doctrines, Streams of <hi>Abanah and Pharpar Rivers of Damascus;</hi> I thought it necessary to send these Papers abroad to vindicate the Divine Majesty, to excite men to a holy Perseverance, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune them by the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Motives, not to forsake our Church, and the Doctrines taught by her; which, provided men joyn practice to profession, will infallibly lead them to a glorious Eternity, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which is the expectation of the Saints. And by the Rules of Justice your Lordship may challenge a Title to this
<pb facs="tcp:199330:6"/> Dedication; first from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation I stand in to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, seeing you have ranked me (though unworthy) in the number of your Chaplains, as also from the consideration of those signal and transcendent Favours conferred upon me; which great Obligation, seeing my Meanness cannot discharge, I hope your Candour and Ingenuity will accept the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest of a thankful Acknowledgement and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration. Besides this is none of the least Motives of this my obsequious Address, that what I heartily desire of others is happily fulfilled in
<pb facs="tcp:199330:6"/> your Lordship, <hi>viz.</hi> a firm Adhesion to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her Doctrines, grounded upon Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; and I request your Lordship to give me lieve to acquaint the World, how rare an Example and Monument of Christian Stedfastness you have been. 'Tis well known you have visited remote Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, you have seen the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Glories of the Triple Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained your first received Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and not deserted our Communion: therefore I make no question but God has ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb facs="tcp:199330:7"/> your Lordship with additions of earthly Grandeur even here, made you a Star of the first Magnitude, and the Glory of our Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. May your Lordship still proceed to be a lively Mirrour of Constancy, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Sobriety to this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and impure Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may others by the conductive Rayes of so No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Guide and Pattern, be directed into the straight paths of a holy and laudable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</p>
            <p>I have no more but to bow my knees to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:199330:7"/> of Lights, that he would bless your Lordship with all manner of Blessings in Jesus Christ; that his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle may shine upon you, and his Dew lie upon your Branches; that your Peace may be as the River, and your Glory as the mighty Streams; and after a long and prosperous abode in this Sublunary Region, you may be received into rhe Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Number, and Blessed Company of Overcoming Saints, who shall sit down in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> And this shall

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:199330:9"/> conclude it to be St. <hi>Paul;</hi> so St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> takes it for undeniable. 'Tis questioned why he did not prefix his name: Some say that it was for the avoiding of Scandal; for many of the Jews were not a little scandalized at St. <hi>Paul,</hi> because he turned to the Gentiles, and deserted the Twelve Tribes: he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing therefore that the <hi>odium</hi> they bare to his Person, would reflect upon his Doctrine, and so make it unacceptable, he prudently conceals his name. Others say he did it out of Modesty; for though out of the exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy of his Love, he desired with all zeal and earnestness the salvation of his kindred according to the flesh, yet the Jews being then the peculiar Charge of St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Lapide.</note> he would not be seen openly to write unto them, lest it should be thought he played the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in another man's Diocess, and put his Sickle into another man's Harvest.</p>
               <p>This Epistle was early received into the Canon by the Greek Church, but not in the Latin till after the time of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> after the Third Century; but then it was embraced as Authentick, and has very good authority both by Canons of Councils,<note place="margin">De authoritate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist ad Hebraeos vid.

               <p>The End and Scope of this Epistle is two-fold; 1. Information, to inform them of the Excellency of Jesus Christ; as to his Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty making him co-eternal with the Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting him with a true Divinity long before the Assumption of our Humane Nature, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to that Heresie of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bud, and afterwards came to more maturity in the days of <hi>Arius</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Socinians in these times, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his eternal Existence, and make him a God improperly and analogically. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he informs them of the excellency of the Priesthood of Jesus Christ above that of the Judaical and Ceremonial Law; for he shews that he is not so much a Priest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aronical as of the Melchisedechian Order: the first of which consisted in the offering up of Sacrifices, <hi>viz.</hi> of Bulls and Goats, which were typical, figurative and temporary, and now had their due and full accomplishment by the once offering up of the immaculate Lamb, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Christ himself; whereas the Melchisede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian Priesthood consists in Benediction <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18 and 19. and this Christ especially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms; for 'tis said <hi>He blesses us in turning us from our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 3.26.</note> that is, uses all possible and powerful means by his Word,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Hammond in locum.</note> Spirit and Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bring us to Repentance and newness of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199330:10"/> Life. And this Priesthood is not to give way to another dispensation, as the Aaronical, but is to be perpetual, and everlasting, that is, till the consummation of all things, and till he deliver up the Kingdom to the Father.</p>
               <p>Again another End of this Epistle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, to establish them in their espoused Religion; and to this purpose he all along ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them <hi>to strengthen the feeble knees, and lift up the weak hands,</hi> and <hi>not to throw away their confidence, which has great recompence of reward;</hi> he sets before them a multitude of holy Saints, a Cloud of Witnesses, which all looked to Jesus, and died in the Faith, and embraced the Promises of a future <hi>Messiah,</hi> and he entreats them in like manner (seeing Christ is now revealed) they have cognizance of his Doctrine, are assured of his Mission from the Father, and so have owned him and believed on him, as the great Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by <hi>Moses</hi> their ancient Lawg-giver, to <hi>hold fast this their profession without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,</hi> without declining to Judaism on the one side, or Gentilism on the other, or the perswasions of the sensual Gnosticks, whose neutrality and indifferency in Religon was remarkable and conspicuous.</p>
               <p>Some conceive, that because it is said in the Verse before, <hi>having your bodies sprinkled with pure water,</hi> and now it following, <hi>hold sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast your profession,</hi> that he intimates thus
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199330:11"/> much, That the profession of Faith, owned and rehearsed in Baptism (understood by the pure water) should be strictly and inviolably adhered to; for it is certain that the Church at the first was made up of persons adult, and as certain it is, that when such persons were baptized they made a Confession of their Faith: For <hi>Philip</hi> asked the Eunuch before his Baptism; <hi>Believest thou?</hi> and he gave this answer, <hi>I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, Acts</hi> 8.37. and St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Cypr. Epist. <hi>70.</hi>
                  </note> that in his time they asked the baptized, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest thou Remission of sins, everlasting Life, &amp;c.</hi> and he said, <hi>I do believe.</hi> So <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi> upon the place says, <hi>We confessed in the beginning of our faith</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">

Time was when a Wolf in <hi>England</hi> and a venomous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Ireland</hi> were not more rare than these prophane wretches and first born of Satan; and if there were any, they usually were like Moles and Bats and Birds of the night seldom seen, but covered both their Persons
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199330:13"/> and Doctrines with the Canopies of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and silence. Atheism that was before but a pitiful Embryo, is now grown up to the stature of a man, a bare-faced enemy, like <hi>Saul,</hi> higher by the head than the most pestilent Heresies: 'Tis now a vaunting <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> and bids defiance (as the Giants of old) to God and Heaven, to Reason and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the whole Armies of Israel; and if you will believe these bold assailants, all these things are as so many slighted Forts, ready to be calked on us the glorious trophies of their unsearchable Wit and unparallel'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny. And, as many of the great ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Jews espoused Sadducism; so (the greater may be the lamentation) many of noble Extraction are so intoxicated with this poison, that with many'tis accounted but half-dyed Gallantry, if it have not a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som tincture of Atheism.</p>
                  <p>It was of old one of the Laws of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> that a Strumpet should not touch the Altar of <hi>Juno,</hi> such a reverence they had for a feigned Goddess; but 'tis nothing for the wanton tongues of these pert men to strike at the divine Essence, at him that <hi>draweth out the Heavens like a Curtain, and holdeth the waters in the hollow of his hand,</hi> and in comparison of whom the Inhabitants of the Earth are as so many Grashoppers: 'Tis nothing with them to revile the Divine Oracles, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199330:13"/> vilifie the Laws of <hi>Moses</hi> with the title of Solemn Fooleries, and the Institutions of Christ as pieces of Pageantry; to brag they have only an outward man to look after, which requires their care and sollicitude; that style the Lord's Ambassadors, the Lights of the Earth, as so many glaring Exhalations, State-puppets, that speak only the sence of a Law giver, and awe men into a <hi>Decorum:</hi> And these are accounted men of Learning and of the greatest accomplishments, witty to a miracle; unanswerable, because whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they write is a perfect miscellany of Nonsence and Obscenity, and 'tis a shame for a Christian and a man of Sobriety to make a Rejoynder. These are also stout and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in their own imaginations, like that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Courtier <hi>Proculus</hi> in the days of the Emperour <hi>Probus, Qui inter fortes se habere credens, si criminum densitate coalescat, Who thought that the multiplication of Vices was the way to make him valorous:</hi> and thus like Cocks of the game they crow, flourish and bravado; not that they are unconquerable, but that modest men and pious Souls will not step up on to their dunghil (for fear of defilement) to cope with them: and indeed these men are not fit to be meddled with, that bring Oaths for Arguments, scurrilous Jestings for sober Reasonings, and a piece of obscene Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry for a Demonstration.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:199330:14"/>
                  <p>But let us hold fast our Profession against these perswasions. And to this purpose, 1. Consider, what were all the World out of their wits, under mists and <hi>deliriums,</hi> cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Intellectuals, benighted in their Judgments, till these <hi>Cato's</hi> dropt out of the Clouds, and these novel Pedagogues gave the World a new Information? What were all the Persian <hi>Magi,</hi> the <hi>Sophi's</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> the Indian <hi>Gymnosophists,</hi> the Roman <hi>Augurs,</hi> the Jewish <hi>Rabbins</hi> and the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who had several apprehensions of a Deity and various Modes of Worship, all pur-blind and doltish, till these youngsters appeared? Was there ever a Race of men did sympathize with them in their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? 'Tis true here and there we may find one or other speaking contemptuously of their Deities, as <hi>Diagoras, Pherecides</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoras,</hi> whom the Athenians banished as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals in this particular. But you never heard of a Community or Society of men agreeing in these Principles, which are assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the greatest and most unquestionable Topicks. Once a Philosopher affirmed Snow was black; but must all the World be his Proselytes, because he maintained such a non-sensical Assertion? So possibly we may in this Age or the other Century meet with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist, but mankind in the general has had other Conceptions; 'tis an Errour Humanity
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199330:14"/> never consented to; and if in these days it be as an Epidemical disease with which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral are infected, we must remember we live in the dregs of time, and the Devil is as busie to make all sin as spreading and prolifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as he can, because he knows his time is but short. For if we cast our eyes abroad and consider the inhabitants of the great and spacious world, you will find none but they own something or other as a supreme being, though they are mistaken through ignorance or misperswasion. For most true it is what <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and many more beside him have affirmed, <hi>Intelligi necesse est esse Deos quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam insitas eorum vel potius innatas cognitiones habemus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cicero lib. <hi>1.</hi> de na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Deorum.</note>
                     <hi>We must needs believe that there are gods, because the opinion of them is so generally ingrafted or rather inbred in our minds:</hi> And the Idolatry continually practised was a certain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of a Deity; and the great thing which made the Heathens so much detest the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians was, because they looked upon them as broaching injurious Doctrines to their received Gods, which made them cry out to the Emperour ever and anon, <hi>Tolle Atheos, Takeaway the Atheists,</hi> that is, the Christians, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> says. And when the Christian Religion had run through the several regions of the World, as the foresaid <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertul. lib. adv. Jud.</note> the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199330:15"/>
                     <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Getes,</hi> the Roman Precincts, the Spanish borders, the Gallick Provinces, and the unaccessible places of <hi>Britain,</hi> it was closed with upon this account that it was the most excellent way of worshipping and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Divine Majesty. Therefore those that come with their new and impious Lessons and Arguments against the glorious God, never learned them from the Creeds and Confessions of their Progenitors; but as <hi>Herostratus</hi> to be famous fired the Temple of <hi>Diana;</hi> so these, that they may be cried up for men of rare Parts and reaching Capacities, forge these irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conclusions out of the shop of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Understandings, which at one and the same time shew the Author's Ignorance and Impiety.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, Consider all Nations have not only had some transient Notions of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, but have outwardly evidenced it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by Worship, Homage, Obedience, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Service which they have yielded to their respective Gods; which absolutely shews that they looked upon themselves, as under an indispensible necessity of performing such and such Rites, as testifications of a divine Dominion and their Subjection. And this is so known and publickly notorious, that I need not instance in any of the particular Rites which were used in honour of <hi>Jupiter, Bacchus, Minerva</hi> and the rest, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199330:15"/> may remit the capacious Reader to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Theology, where he may receive suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient information. But to this the Atheist replies, That the Notions and Service of a Deity are not genuine and connate Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the prints of Education and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick contrivance of cunning Legislators and Divines, on purpose to promote their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and to keep men from Rebellions and Conspiracies. To this I answer, These ways I grant, that the Notion of a Deity and the conviction of service to it is much improved by good Nurture and the infusion of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Precepts in the Infancy and Minority; but that the Soul has no Notions or <hi>Ideas</hi> of those things but what is obtained by this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary way, is highly absurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and repugnant to all received Maxims and Testimonies. For I argue, Suppose that this and the foregoing Generation taught their Children a mode of Worship, yet let us run it up to the Fountain, who taught the Sons of <hi>Adam, Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> to offer Sacrifice? either they had some divine Revelation so to do, or were prompted to it by the Law of Nature, or were taught so to do by their father <hi>Adam:</hi> Now the Atheist will not say they were incited to sacrifice by the two first, for then the Plea is unquestionable on our side; It remains therefore as a Conclusion, That <hi>Adam</hi> instructed them in this Duty: If
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199330:16"/> so, then I further argue, that certainly he saw some reason or supervening necessity for such a Duty, or else he would neither have done it himself nor have required the same of his posterity: For what man will oblige his Heirs or Successors to pay a Pension or yearly Rent, suppose to a King or Lord of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, except it were just and legal and upon good considerations. Now Sacrifice is that Homage which we owe to God, whose Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are and upon whom we have our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; would <hi>Adam</hi> therefore the wisest of men, have entailed this upon <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> and succeeding Generations, as a sign of their obedience and subordination to a Deity, if there had been no such thing existent? Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they must make <hi>Adam</hi> a very <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> or confess themselves a company of presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous brain-sick Animals, in skrewing their Wits and mustering up of Arguments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne that God in whom they <hi>live, move and have their being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But again, whereas they say, that the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God is merely upon the account of Education, let me present them with an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of <hi>Elian,</hi> who shews in one of his Chapters that few or none of the Barbarians ever were Atheists, and those were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that wanted Education: Now if these had not Arts and Sciences as many Grecians and others had to civilize them, and yet were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199330:16"/> so great adorers of a Deity, then this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection falls to the ground; for if the <hi>Celtae,</hi> the <hi>Indians,</hi> and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom <hi>Elian</hi> reckons up,<note place="margin">Elian lib. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>43.</hi>
                     </note> did observe divine Rites and Ceremonies, and had but bad Tutors or Instructors, then 'tis certain they did them by the dictates ond impulse of the Law of Nature which we contend for. And indeed 'tis most probable that all the Atheism in those times came from some conceited and prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Athenians, who did it to get the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of excellent Wits and bold Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, that scorned to walk in the common Road of received Maxims; and we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conclude that 'tis so with us in these days, for you do not find a sorry labourer, or a herdsman of <hi>Tekoah</hi> a defier of the ever blessed God, but only some petty Wits that would have the Titles of great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, learned Rabbies, profound Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, who broach these impious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Conclusions; for the meanest of the poor and most barbarous Savages (if men will not believe the Records of former Ages,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hackluit</hi>'s English Voyages, <hi>volum</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 737 and 819.</note> yet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the attestation of our own Travellers) have been devout and obsequious to their assumed Gods; for Captain <hi>Drake</hi> who in his furthest travel to the North-west, taking land in

                     <hi>Nova Albion,</hi> found the Natives about a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and Captain <hi>Candish</hi> in his furthest tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to the South-East, taking land in the Island of <hi>Capul,</hi> observed the Inhabitants to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of that which he imagined to be a Devil: Now these people had not the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of any good Education, having no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Laws, Pedagogues or <hi>Sophi's</hi> amongst them to instruct them, as the other part of the civiliz'd world; which is a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that the Notion of a Deity does not totally or primitively result from Education and the Instructions and Infusions of Ancestors and Forefathers.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the Second Part of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the apprehensions of a Supreme Power are only the Contrivances of Law-givers and Divines, to promote their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and facilitate their Regiment among the unwary multitude, I shall, I hope, infringe it sufficiently by shewing that the two Legislators <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ and the holy Apostles did not in the least act out of such pretences, but reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely followed a divine Revelation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. And first for <hi>Moses,</hi> who was the Leader of Israel out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and afterwards was their principal Ruler, I shall I hope evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonstrate, that it could not be done upon any Politick account for him to attempt so great a Design, as to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Israel from the Egyptian Bondage
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:199330:17"/> and Servittude. If we consider first, there was no Policy for <hi>Moses</hi> to return to <hi>Egypt,</hi> having been declared formerly by one of their holy Scribes (as <hi>Josephus</hi> informs us in his Antiquities) to be one that would be the ruine of that Monarchy; for the above named Author Mentions, that an Egyptian that had a Prophetick Spirit, declared to the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that one of the Israelitish Off-spring would be their ruine. And the same <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> brings in this Story; That when <hi>Moses</hi> was a Child, and the King's Daughter <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutis</hi> had brought him into the presence of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that the King put his Crown upon the Child's Head, and the Child in a seeming passion threw the Crown upon the ground and trampled upon it; and this prophetical Scribe being present, told the King in positive termes, this Child was the person that would doe that fatal evil, he had predicted, to the Egyptians; and he counselled the King to make him away. And he had been sacrificed as a victime to their fury if <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter had not interposed: now for <hi>Moses</hi> lying under such a prejudice to think to goe into <hi>Egypt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain where he might imagine he would be ensnared and made away as an enemy to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and the Peoples safety, was a most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous contrivance, if divine Revelation had not superseded all such conceptions.</p>
                  <p>Besides <hi>Moses</hi> had killed an Egyptian, and it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:199330:18"/> was known, and he was glad to flee for it into the Land of <hi>Madian;</hi> now for him to returne thither where as soon as he came he might have been arraigned for Murther or Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, was a journey which no intelligent man would have undertaken: better to Keep sheep in <hi>Madian</hi> then to be executed in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, suppose that <hi>Moses</hi> had not been in the former Circumstances; yet considering his Quality, and the usefulness of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to the Egyptians, it was the most impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Design to undertake that ever was heard of: For <hi>Moses</hi> was but a sorry Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and so looked on at best as a mean Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian, no Orator as himself acknowledged; yet for him to go to a great King, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to let six hundred thousand men depart his Dominions, who did all the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and made the Bricks for Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids, and the Walls against the inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Nilus,</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us; what an unlikely design is this? For suppose that when the King of <hi>France</hi> is warring against <hi>Holland</hi> and the Confederate Armies, and labours to get all the men he can to promote his great Designs: Now if so be that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable Rustick, such an one as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture <hi>Moses</hi> was, should come to him and tell him, that he desired him in the Name of God to disband the Armies, to let all his Forces and Auxiliaries go home and serve
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:199330:18"/> God quietly, and so perswade him to let all these great undertakings be broken off; would not the King and Courtiers be ready to kick him out as a foolish Enthusiastical <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus?</hi> This was the case of <hi>Moses;</hi> yet he went confidently to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> overlooked all objections and impossibilities that might have been pretended; which shews that not humane Policy, but divine Revelation, was his Pole-star and Director.</p>
                  <p>Farther, I pray consider when <hi>Moses</hi> had got lieve of the King for their dismission, how unpolitick is he in the leading of this great Army: For if he had been a cunning Geographer, and had observed the position and situation of Ways and Climats, he would not have led them thus to be entangled by the Mountains and Red Sea, which did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their passage, and would infallibly have caused him to have been an unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prey to the pursuing Egyptians, if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle had not made way for their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Besides, when they had mastered that difficulty, and had got into the Wilderness, was it policy to keep them wandring there forty years, where there were such mean conveniencies for so numerous a multitude? Why did he not go on with speed to the Land of Promise and the desirable <hi>Canaan,</hi> but only that he observed the divine Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who <hi>sware in his wrath that Generation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:199330:19"/> should not enter into his rest,</hi> because of their aggravating and reiterated Impieties with which they had provoked the eyes of the Lord's jealousie: Besides, let it be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the last place, that <hi>Moses</hi> acted not as a Politician; for he did not design to make the Government hereditary, neither did he seek the advancement of his own Off-spring, as we see the wise men of the World do, but delegated his Power and Jurisdiction to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> his Minister, according as the Lord had appointed: see <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.9. and so he suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in that Magistracy. All which things being duly pondered, shew that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did not in the least consult flesh and blood, or acted out of rational &amp; politick Principles, but in all his Actions was guided by that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Mover, who put him upon this strange and stupendious Errant and Employment.</p>
                  <p>Next let us consider whether our Blessed Lord and Saviour and his Apostles acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of these prudential accounts, (which they suppose them to do) on purpose to gain that Secular Interest, Advancement or Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty which they conjecture, they might aim a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in these Designs and Enterprizes.</p>
                  <p>First, It was impossible Christ could have any design of Self-promotion in this juncture of time, when the Roman Empire might be said to shine in its greatest Lustre and Glory that ever it did; when as a great part of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:199330:19"/> habitable World put its neck under that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Yoke: <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had been subdued, and now the Germans, the Gauls, the Britains and what not? all made Tributary, and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Palestine</hi> governed by the Roman Procurators, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls, Tetrarchs, Kings and others, Substitutes appointed by the Emperour and Senate.</p>
                  <p>It appears that Christ had not the least thought to infringe the Liberties and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of <hi>Caesar,</hi> both because he publickly proclaimed <hi>his Kingdom was not of this world,</hi> commanded <hi>to give to Caesar things that were Caesar's;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 22.21.</note> wrought a Miracle,<note place="margin">John 6.15.</note> rather than not pay the exacted Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, that so they might not have any suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of any disaffection to that Monarchy. And when the people upon the view of his Miracles, supposing him to be the promised <hi>Messias</hi> would have made him a King, then was the time for the Politician to have made his Market; but he was not ambitious of that temporal Preeminence, but absented himself, delaring his dislike of such Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Preferment; which shews that here was nothing of Humane policy, but only that he came (as he said) <hi>to do the will of his Father,</hi> and to fulfil the great work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to which from all Eternity he was designed. Besides, the Apostles were never
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199330:20"/> animated by such a Spirit as sought Earthly Grandeur; for who can imagine that Twelve naked men should ever reduce Cities, Forts and Castles to their obedience: they seemed rather to run upon the Swords points, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Sins and Vices of the times, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersing the espoused Deities of the World, preaching a Religion contrary to the humour and Genius of the Kings and <hi>Sophi's</hi> of that Generation; so that they were whipt, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, stoned, imprisoned, made the dross and off-scouring of all things: and to be sure if they had not had the Warrant and Express of Heaven, they would never have ventured upon these formidable Encounters. None ever heard of an Apostle that secretly promoted fewds betwixt Kings and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, that busied himself about warlike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and military preparations, that ever gave a word of advice how to manage such and such Hostilities, or to get these and the other Auxiliaries, which are the business and employment of Politicians: But they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Christ and him crucified,</hi> Self-denial, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Resignation, Love and Unity, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Mindedness, Industry after an Eternal Kingdom and Inheritance, (as might be shown at large:) Therefore it is a mere Sophism of the Atheist, to say that Religion is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of wise and sagacious men; for we see <hi>Moses,</hi> Christ and his Apostles did not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199330:20"/> act upon such a ground or <hi>Basis</hi> as these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, but followed the Dictates of the over-ruling God, who prescribed them their Duties, and commissionated them to follow the Rules of his own Wisdom and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</p>
                  <p>I shall not stand to furbish the various Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which may be used against the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist; as those from the Fabrick of the World, whose proportion of parts and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry bespeak an excellent Architect, from Motion which presupposes a <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> or First Mover. From Arts and Sciences, which cannot be supposed to be the fruits of our Ingeny, without the help of divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, as is plain in the case of <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab, Exod.</hi> 36.1. Or from the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirits and <hi>Demons,</hi> which lead us up to one Supreme, Infinite and Immaterial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for this is sufficiently done to my hand by the Learned; but I shall speak a little to those prodigious Acts which have been done upon the Stage of the World contrary to the course of Nature sometimes, and other things which can by no means be done by the Agency of Natural Causes, which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrate there is a Divine power which supersedes all ordinary and physical Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and does whatsoever <hi>pleases</hi> it <hi>in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in Earth, and in the Sea, and in all deep places.</hi> I shall begin with the stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199330:21"/> Acts recorded in Scripture; And the first thing which presents it self to our confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Deluge in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> which was long before and much exceeded the <hi>Ogy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> and <hi>Deucalionian</hi> Floods, than which the Heathens usually rise no higher for want of History; and was not this a strange thing that the Water which had kept within its ordinary precincts for the space of 1656. years should break its bounds, and put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the Life and Being of the then survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mortals; surely there was a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power which had a hand in this doleful Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>Some foolish Atheists say, that this was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by natural Causes, seeing (as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm) they find by computation that there was at that time a Conjunction of the moist Planets in the watery <hi>Trigon,</hi> the effects of which are usually Deluges, Inundations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this has an easie answer; for it may be shewed, that there has been a like Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the watery Planets, and yet no such Tragical Effects have ensued. Such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction there was in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Alsted. Chronol.</note> another about the Babylonish Captivity, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fifty one years after Christ, another in the days of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, another in the year 1524. which made all the Astrologers predict fatal consequences, insomuch that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199330:21"/> many in the lower <hi>Germany</hi> left their houses which were in the Valleys and retired to mountanous places,; and one Dr. <hi>Tholosanus</hi> (or <hi>Insanus</hi> rather) made himself a Ship or an Ark for his security against the suspected Deluge: but the Event shewed these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were ridiculous, for it proved a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dry Winter. Therefore we say, If natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conjunctions had such effects the World had again and again been destroyed: we conclude therefore that herein was seen the power of an Omnipotent Agent, who brought this miraculous Judgment on purpose to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Crimes and Exorbitancies of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Generation.</p>
                  <p>But the Atheist laughs again and says, How was it possible that such a quantity of waters could be gathered together, as to over-top the highest Mountains? To this we answer, That in order to the Deluge not only the Sea was let out, the Fountains of the great Deep being broken up, but also the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Cataracts of Heaven were opened, that is, that stock and <hi>congeries</hi> of waters above the Firmament, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.7. was poured down also: For this gathering of the Waters above the Firmament was not the Moisture in the Clouds, as some imagine; for we read of these Waters before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun, which is the producer of such Exhalations. Now then the Sea being let
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:199330:22"/> loose, and the Waters in the Veins and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the Earth; together with that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury above the Firmament being all called upon the surface of the Earth, what a rise of waters must here of necessity be? and to help which, the waters in the Clouds also and middle Region joyned forces, which is very considerable, God calling them in <hi>Job, the Treasures of Snow.</hi> And this I know by experience, that by fall of one Snow and a Thawe upon it, a small River which I my self have gone twenty times over in Summer dry-shod, yet this River did rise perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly about fourteen or fifteen foot, as I took notice by the Trees on the Bank side, which had their bark pilled off by the pieces of Ice which floated upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the waters: and if the waters rise so high by the fall of some Rain or Snow, what is to be expected when lieve is given to the waters to overflow, and the water in the Clouds and those other above the Firmament to be united and jointly poured upon the Earth: I do not in the least scruple the Truth of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as to the Altitude of the waters, having such rational and concurring Causes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others say it was not necessary that all the Earth should be overflowed, but only the inhabited part of it: For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge being a punishment for the Sin of Man, there was no need for the water to cover the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:199330:22"/> uninhabitable part of the World, but only those territories where the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> were situated, which are supposed not to be much above the Confines of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi>
                     </note> and so not over the hundredth part of the Earth was drowned; which if it be so, that inlet of waters which we have above mentioned might easily cause such a high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation as <hi>Moses</hi> asserts. And if the Atheist object against this that place of Scripture which says that <hi>all the fowls of the air died,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Genes. 7.21.</note> and shall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus; That grant the Deluge to be only in <hi>Asia,</hi> the Fowls by their flight (suppose into the European Regions) might evade destruction: We answer, That all the Fowls within the limits of the Deluge could not thus save themselves, because the Rain came with that force and violence that they were not able to bear wing against it; for it is the Opinion of some Divines, that the water from the Clouds came not then <hi>per stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licidia,</hi> by drops and small parcels, but was poured out as out of Spouts and Conduits, which could not but hinder the flight and motion of the agil and winged Creatures. Others bring strenuous and cogent Arguments to prove that the Sea is higher than the Earth, which they demonstrate from drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on a plain Table, which riseth to the eye
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199330:23"/> and has a globular figure; and thus they suppose the Sea to be. They argue also from Springs in the tops of Mountains boiling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, the cause of which they imagine to come from the Sea, the proper Cause of these Emanations, and so they conclude by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Experience, that the water could never ascend thither, except the Fountain and Original were equal and parallel in height with these Eruptions; which if it be, then 'tis no news to have the Earth, even the mountainous part of it covered with waters; especially when God relaxes his power, by which the Sea is miraculously kept within its stated bounds and dimensions: And thus we labour to evince that this Overflowing in the days of <hi>Noah</hi> was extraordinary and supernatural, caused by the power and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightiness of that divine Being which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>Another Prodigy was the dividing the Red Sea before the Children of Israel, when they fled from the face of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> that the water which is a fluid Element, should part asunder and remain as a Wall on the right and left hand, afford a passage to these pursued Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and drown their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemies was altogether preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and could not be done without the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an Omnipotent Agent. Some to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade this are ready to say, That <hi>Moses</hi> was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:199330:23"/> an expert Artist and enquirer into Natural secrets, led the people over at an Ebb or low water, and the Egyptians not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, went so far after them till they were overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the returning Tide, and so were drowned. But this is a vanity, to think that the Egyptians whose Empire reach'd to the Sea, did not understand the ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof; and that amongst an Army of fifty thousand Horsemen and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Footmen, none should know the Motion of the Sea. Besides, <hi>Moses</hi> being brought up in the Learning of the Egyptians, it must be granted that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had some <hi>Sophi's</hi> and Wise men with him which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood greater Mysteries than this; when as every ordinary Fisherman in <hi>England,</hi> by his natural Experience and Observation, can tell you to an hour or less of the putting in of Tides, and Fall again of the water.</p>
                  <p>But again, this is a piece of Nonsence to think that this passage of Israel was at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux or low water; for at the returning of Tides ('tis true) some of the Verges about the Sea as to a little space or compass are left bare: But what is this to the Journey of Israel, who from the Borders of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the opposite Banks on the Arabian side passed the Sea to the length of three Leagues, a thousand paces or nine miles, as Geographers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:199330:24"/> observe; and that the Sea recoils at any time for the space of nine miles let any produce a precedent. But the Scripture is plain, that the Sea was divided, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21. and so they went not over at a low water.</p>
                  <p>But it is objected again, Would the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians be such Fools as to enter the Sea after Israel, and hazard their safety? To this we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That Darkness might hinder the perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the way they were in, and the Cloud which gave Light to Israel was dark to the Egyptians, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.20. and so they could not so well discern this miraculous passage. Secondly, the earnestness of Revenge might cause them inconsiderately to follow Israel, as we see many Creatures will follow the prey thorough all difficulties: Thus <hi>Shimei</hi> pursued his servants, and rashly passed over the Brook <hi>Kidron;</hi> so the Egyptians in their heat and haste made no difference of paths, but directly followed the Israelites. Thirdly, their Confidence which was increased by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, made them thus hazardous; they concluded they might well go where Israel did, like a Boy that will venture on a piece of Ice which bears his companion: and this boldness was augmented by Almighty God, who did harden their hearts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.17. that is, did take away from them the sense of Fear, as hardening usually signifies in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi> And so it remains for a Truth that the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:199330:24"/> waters of the Sea were separated and divided by a miraculous force and vertue; the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of this and such like Dispensations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently shewing that there is a God.</p>
                  <p>From hence we pass to the standing still of the Sun in the time of <hi>Joshua,</hi> a strange and extraordinary Act, in which no doubt Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency was the Cause and Author. But says the Atheist, this is contradicted two ways: First. By some of the Jewish Rabbins, who say, that the Sun did go down as at other times; but this was a Globe of Light like one of the <hi>Parelii</hi> or Mock-Suns, which gave light in the Horizon till <hi>Joshua</hi> discomfited his enemies. <hi>Answer.</hi> We are to believe Scripture rather than the Cabalistical dreams of many Jews. But suppose it mere a Globe of Light, it was very miraculous and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd, and shows the assistance of Divinity in making such a diaphanous and transparent Brightness, which supplied the place of the Sun and gave Light to <hi>Joshua.</hi> But say they, this Miracle is gainsayed by the new Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers of the Copernican and Cartesian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who boldly affirm that the Earth moves. <hi>Answer.</hi> In case it were so, yet as to Motion in general there was a Miracle; there was such an alteration in the Measure and Method of Time as could not have hapned without a divine Efficiency, all Created Powers not being able to make Additions or Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:199330:25"/> as to times and seasons. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this noise about the Motion of the Earth, yet many of the Learned will not own it for a Topick or veracious Doctrine: For first they say that Miracles being the great Seals and Confirmation of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and testifications of a Deity, it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to assert any thing which may make them invalid or insignificant: Besides they say Argumenrs from Sense are not to be sleighted; and whereas these Opinionists ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, That Sense is not a competent Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of distance, they reply, That though Sense be not a competent Judge as to perfect and Mathematical strictness and exactness at such a distance, yet it can judge in a good degree; if otherwise, why should we believe any thing that is reported of the Heavenly Bodies, or give credence to those things which are discovered by the help of Tubes and Telescopes, seeing the Eye of Man is the main and Principal Agent in the finding out these Secrets and Rarities? They say further, that if Arguments from Sense be not authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, then possibly <hi>Marcion</hi> and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks might be in the right, who affirmed that Christ had only an imaginary Body, whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince by sensible Demonstrations. And Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation also might be a more credible Doctrine, if Sense may not be believed, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:199330:25"/> Papists asserting that though we see the plain and palpable Elements of Bread and Wine, yet they are properly and really the Body and Blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But leaving these things to those that will trouble their Heads with Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notions, we are satisfied that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, whether they own the old or new Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, joyntly acknowledge a Miracle as to the standing still of the Sun in the time of <hi>Joshua.</hi> And if it be objected, Why did none of the Heathens take notice of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Day? We say, that their Histories not beginning till about the Trojan War, and this happening many Centuries before, they had no intimation of it; only the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed think, that when God brought back the Sun so many degrees in the time of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> they had some rude Notions thereof, when they report how <hi>Jupiter</hi> prolonged the night when he committed Adultery with <hi>Alomene</hi> the Wife of <hi>Amphytrion,</hi> upon whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Hercules,</hi> which is the cause of a long Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Fable in their Mythology.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we further to consider the Cause of the Darkness of the Sun in the day of Christ's Crucifixion, which was against all Rules and Orders of Nature whatsoever; for it was no Eclipse, because the Moon was in the full, and Eclipses happen not then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and the East-part of the Sun was first
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:199330:26"/> obscured and first restored, which, as they say, happens not in ordinary Eclipses. And this was particularly taken notice of by <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> the Areopagite, a man skilful in Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who being at <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding this Miracle, cryed out, <hi>Either the God of Nature suffers, or the Frame of the World is to be dissolved:</hi> All which may be seen in his Writings, to wit, in his 7. Epistle to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and in his 11. Epistle to <hi>Apollophanes.</hi> And as these Miracles, so all the others acted by Christ in the Gospel do fully shew a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Energy; as to cure the Blind, the Deaf and Dumb, the Lunatick and Paralytick, the Ejection of Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more particularly, that of <hi>Lazaruss</hi> is truly notable, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been dead four days was certainly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; for the Physicians say that seventy two hours are allotted for the Revolution of Humours, and the Body that remains so long dead naturally putrifies. Now the Scripture says of <hi>Lazarus, John</hi> 11 39. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that he was dead four days,</hi> to the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whom a Divine power must of necssity contribute. How strange a Relation is that of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> quoted in his works from good Authority,<note place="margin">Mede pag. <hi>767.</hi> Vol. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> That in the Country of the <hi>Omerites,</hi> the Jews and the Christians having a Disputation for three days without hope of conquest on either side, at last there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:199330:26"/> a terrible Thunder, and Christ himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon a rorid Cloud and uttered these words in an audible voice, <hi>Ecce ego appareo vobis qualis à patribus vestris fui crucifixus; Behold I appear to you in the same form I was in when I was crucified by your Fathers;</hi> the Christians cryed <hi>Miserere, Lord and Christ have mercy upon us;</hi> the Jews were struck with blindness which could not be removed till they were baptized. I shall also insert here that wonderful discourse of <hi>Camerarius</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller of the Common-wealth of <hi>Nuremberg</hi> in the 73. Chapter of his Historical Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, concerning the Resuscitants of <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Not far from that City there is a little barren Mountain, where, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Tradition, a company of Christians met together in order to Divine Worship, but being set upon by their Enemies, were hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in pieces and covered with Earth; since which time in <hi>March</hi> every year for three days together may be seen a perfect Emblem of the Resurrection: for there you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Legs, Arms, Thighs and other Members of the Body arising out of the earth, and are touched by several of the Spectators, and by little and little they hide themselves in the ground again. This is confirmed, as my Author says, by <hi>Felix</hi> a Jacobine of <hi>Ʋlmes,</hi> in his History of the admirable things of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> and several other Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:199330:27"/> are brought in attesting the truth of this History; all sober persons concluding that it is no Satanical Illusion, but an omnipotent Act of God, to convince the impious Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Egypt</hi> that there is a Resurrection and Life to come.</p>
                  <p>What strange discoveries of Murders and punishments upon the Authors do we find; which can be nothing else but the Acts of God and the Effects of his Providence, which the very Heathens were convinced of. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us concerning <hi>Mitius</hi> the Argive, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slain in a Sedition, a brazen Statue which stood up in the Market-place fell upon his Murtherer before a great concourse of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The like he relates of <hi>Bessus</hi> the Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, who having killed his Father, and keeping the murther secret, being invited to a Feast there was a Nest of Swallows, which made a great chattering in the Chimney; he arose from the Table in great anger, and with the end of his Spear threw down the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Nest: his Friends asking him the reason of that furious act; said he, <hi>Do you not hear what the Swallows said,</hi> viz. <hi>that I kill'd my Father:</hi> Tidings of which being brought to the King, and Circumstances examined, he was found to be the Criminal, and received condign punishment.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Lucknois</hi> Merchant residing in <hi>England,</hi> sent word to his friends he would be with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:199330:27"/> them within six weeks, and accordingly takes his journey; his Man who was with him murders him in his way to <hi>Paris:</hi> While he was committing this Villany, a blind man led only by a Dog asks who it was that groaned? the Murtherer replies, it was a sick man that was easing himself. The Servant getting his Master's Bills, takes up great summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and sets up a new shop at <hi>Roan;</hi> the Merchant's friends making enquiry for him, and a Carcase being found in the Vines half eaten they suspect his Murder: hereupon they make enquiry what strangers had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into those parts, and who had set up a new shop, and the Murtherer is taken and examined upon suspicion, which he stoutly denied before <hi>Bigot</hi> the King's Attorney: they being at a loss for want of Evidence, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the blind man comes to the House where <hi>Bigot</hi> was, and tells them what a groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he heard upon the way, which he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected might be the voice of the murthered Merchant; they asked the blind man if he could know again the voice of him that spake to him, he said he believed he could; then they made twenty men successively to speak before him, but he said none of those voices were such as he heard; then they made the Murtherer speak, and he presently cryed out, That is the Voice I heard on the Mountain where the Rode lay. This was reiterated
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:199330:28"/> three or four times,, and still he challenged none but the Murtherer, whom they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and he before execution confessed all, and acknowledged he was detected by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence: So <hi>Pasquier</hi> in his Book of French Remarks.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Itzhow</hi> in <hi>Denmark</hi> a man was found slain in the field, the murderer fled, but the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate made one of the hands of the slain man be cut off &amp; hung in a string in one of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Town-prison; ten years after the Murtherer coming into the Prison, the dried Hand dropped Blood upon one of the Tables underneath; hereupon they stayed the man, he confessed the fact, and gave glory to God: all which things do shew an over-ruling Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. To which I might add all the notable Prodigies during the first and second Punick War, and others which happened in like manner in the time of the Civil jarrs betwixt <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> others before the death of <hi>Galba,</hi> the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the like about the end of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian</hi> Persecution;<note place="margin">Vide Evagr.

                     </note> all which were so remarkable that the very Heathens themselves looked upon them as Effects proceeding from incensed Deities; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease which they had Lustrations, Prayers, Offerings, popitiatory Sacrifices, and the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendialia Sacra</hi> or the Expiations for nine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:199330:28"/> days, were instituted by the Romans upon this account; All which shew their belief of a Supreme Being, which for us to contemn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks us the most notorious examples of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>But consider again, (and though it be but an old, yet) it remains an unanswerable Plea, If there be no such thing as a God, and if Religion be a Vanity and a <hi>Chimera,</hi> how comes it to pass that Conscience checks, and the thoughts of a future State amaze us? What need men be under this corroding Worm, when they have committed some hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Crime and Irregularity, if so be there is no Superiour to whom we are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Surely it was a strange Pusillanimity in <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble at that discourse of the great Apostle, when he preached <hi>of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Temperance and Judgment to come,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. But it was the consciousness of his own Impieties which made him be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a commotion, when he heard of the doom and fate of such Exorbitances; for he was culpable in all the particulars St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached on: First for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Hammond in loc.</note> he had exercised much Cruelty, and undue Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations had taken place in his Goverment; and for Temperance he had trangressed the Rules and Laws of that Vertue, by taking his Wife <hi>Drusilla</hi> by the force of Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:199330:29"/> from her Husband's Bed, and hearing there would be a time of account, and a day of reckoning for such misdemeanours he was concerned; and what-ever <hi>Paul</hi> preached, Conscience made application of it, which put him into no little palpitations and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> What made <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as the Historian tells us, be so troubled, that all his Fortunes and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements of the Empire could afford him no tranquillity? We find <hi>Cain</hi> running about like a trembling Vagabond after his Fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; <hi>Nero</hi> frighted with the Ghost of his Mother <hi>Agrippina; Caligula</hi> fearing <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and running under his Bed when it thundred (though at other times he derided his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy:) Now if so be that there were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging God, but that men when they were resolved into dust never were to rise and act another part, and their Souls vanished into soft Air, what need Conscience be under these disquietings and vexations, these fears and haunting jealousies? Might not a man shake off such perplexing thoughts as <hi>Sampson</hi> the Cords, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Viper? And the truth is, <hi>Cicero</hi> largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains what the Furies were which the Poets feigned tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented these and the other;<note place="margin">Cicero in Oratione contra L. Pisonem.</note> he plainly says, <hi>Sua quemque fraus, suum facinus, suum scelus de sanitate &amp; de mente deturbat; haec sunt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:199330:29"/> impiorum furiae, flammae, faces;</hi> that is, <hi>Every man's fraud, and sin, and wickedness is the great disturber of his comforts; these are the Furies, the flames, the firebrands which do affright and scare us;</hi> which certainly could not be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we were to appear before a Tribunal where Rewards and Punishments shall be administred according to the actions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations either of deserving or delinquent Mortals.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Let us consider, if there be no Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or awful God, how come men to be so startled and amused when they come to die, and to lay down this earthly Tabernacle? For take a Gallant that drunk Scorning like water, that was like <hi>Behemoth</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>laughed at the spear and habergeon,</hi> that was as a brazen Wall against all the essays and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults made by the Ambassadors of Heaven; yet when a Disease comes and brings a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage (as to <hi>Hezekiah) Set thy house in order, thou shalt die;</hi> when the Blood boyls, the Head achs, the Pulse irregular, and all the internal operations disorderly; when there is no other way but one, <hi>linquenda domus, &amp; tellus, &amp; placens uxor;</hi> when all their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to shake hands with them, then they are tame, gentle and meek to a miracle; then they can be content to talk with a man in black, whom they so lately laughed at; then God and Christ, formerly despised, are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:199330:30"/> solemnly invocated as appears from these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Examples: First, of <hi>Tullius Hostilius,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Numa</hi> in his Kingdom, and being a Martial man, made a scorn of <hi>Numa</hi>'s Religion and holy Rites, as if they tended to nothing but the effeminating and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mens minds; but afterwards <hi>(morbo gravi, &amp; multiplici)</hi> by a strange and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sickness he had, and smitten with the stroke of divine Justice,<note place="margin">Plutarchus in vita Numae.</note> he repented himself of his profaneness, and as another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, was the most servile afterwards and slavish to all the Gentile Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,<note place="margin">Liv. lib. <hi>1.</hi> pag. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> and transfused the same into all his Subjects: So that he who formerly had derided all Religious services, as so many ridiculous Observances, now for fear of an approaching wrath (which his Soul did apprehend) grew, as I may say, a pious Zealot and devout Practitioner of all those Rites and Adorations with which they did accost their respective Deities.</p>
                  <p>Another Story we have of the Philosopher <hi>Bion</hi> surnamed <hi>Boristenes,</hi> who (as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> tells us in his Life) all the time of his health he was a most obdurate Atheist and opposer of the Gods;<note place="margin">Diog. Laert. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Bion.</note> but afterwards when he was attacked with a most tormenting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, he was thereby induced to repent him
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:199330:30"/> of the Impieties he was guilty of as to the Gods; and we do not hear him any more a Criminal in that particular: now he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to leave these terrestrial Mansions, his timorous Soul fearing he should have bad entertainment in other Regions, relented, and so was drawn to a Recantation. Neither is it to be passed by which is reported of those Persians, who being pursued by the Greeks, and being forced to try a passage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River <hi>Strymon,</hi> which was but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately frozen, then those that the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had talked lavishly and contemptuously of a God, with prayers and tears and a signal affectionateness implored the Divine bounty, that the suspected Ice might not break, but that it might bear them now when they were pursued by an implacable Enemy. And if so be that any question these Authorities, as far fetch'd and possibly invented to credit the design of a Deity, I shall conclude this with a remarkable Narration of as learned a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician as the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> affords, who is no Phanatick I am sure, and told me this following Story of a Gentleman (whom I my self knew) which was to this purpose. Says he, This Person of Quality was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in my company, and was ever inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against these silly Notions of a God, which people had espoused: The Doctor was ready upon all occasions to undeceive him,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:199330:31"/> being a person able to argue with the best of these Antagonists. At last this Gentleman fell sick not far from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> sent again &amp; again for this Doctor; but Providence so ordered it, that this Doctor was taken ill himself, and could not take a journey to the patient whose Distemper proved mortal; and the Doctor assured me, that he was informed by a nigh Relation where he died, that during the time of his sickness he pathetically invocated God and Jesus Christ, and requested their favour and mercy: which was an evident Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that the slumbering Soul was now awakened, and that he looked upon the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of a divine Being and a future Estate as a certain Reality, which before he had scorned as a fabulous Legend and a Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Forgery.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Christian hold fast thy Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against these foolish Cavils of debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched men, Satan's Emissaries, who labour to advance the interest of the Prince of Darkness; and if we will give more credence to the vain janglings of these Sciolists, than to the holy Scriptures, given by divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, confirmed by most remarkable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, received by persons of the greatest Parts and Ingeny, and subscribed to by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conscience, we are fitter to be purged with Helebore, and confined to a <hi>Bethlem,</hi> than to be Members of a Civil Society. And
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:199330:31"/> this I will affirm (not in the least to tax the Wisdom and Gravity of my Superiours, or that I delight in the Execution of sanguinary Laws) that 'tis a hard case that a poor indigent Villain should be whipp'd at a post, or burnt in the hand for petty Larceny, and another climb the Gallows Tree for stealing of some trifles, not much surmounting the value of Thirteen pence half penny, which are but sleight tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes against our Brother; and a Feather-Gallant shall openly blaspheme his God, rail at the Soveraign Majesty of Heaven, who breathed into him the breath of Life, bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Word of Truth, and the Gospel of Salvation; and yet pass untouched by him that ought not to bear the Sword in vain, but be publickly applauded as a man of a great Spirit, rare Adventurers, a Prodigy of Wit and Learning: as if <hi>England</hi> were a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary for Blasphemy; I say, as in the case of the Levite's Concubine, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it, take advice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judges 19.30.</note>
                     <hi>and speak your minds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And one thing more I would have taken into consideration: If a Jesuit be such a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous person in a Common-wealth, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a pre-engagement to his Lord the Pope, and which by virtue of an Equivocation can swear, forswear and unwind himself from all Oaths, Covenants- solemn Vows and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations; what a person is the Atheist, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:199330:32"/> how can a King be sure of his Loyalty and Allegiance? For the greatest security he can have is by the imposition of an Oath, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did to <hi>Shimei;</hi> but now if the Atheist be convinced that 'tis only a nominal and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Divinity that he has invocated, and that there is no such thing as a Perjury-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging God; and that (if with <hi>Zimri</hi> he should slay his Master) there is no divine Power would ever take cognizance of the Crime; I pray of what validity is the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he has given? And what Villany is not this person fit for, if he have but power and opportunity to put his black designs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution? May not I in this case say, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vete vobis Principes, Look to your selves you Kings and Grandees of the world:</hi> For truly I should look upon them with the same Eye of suspicion that <hi>Caesar</hi> did upon <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and <hi>Mauritius</hi> did upon that Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <hi>Phocas;</hi> especially if they be observed to make it their business to be rising, great and popular.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly, Hold fast your Profession against old Pleas and Superstitions, especially those of the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>Christian Religion has ever had the fate to be counted a Novelty; as the Heathen <hi>Symmachus</hi> said, <hi>Nunc dogma nobis Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nascitur, post evolutos mille demum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sules; Now Christian Doctrine begins to spring

                     <hi>Luther,</hi> and the first Reformers, as if they brought new Systems and Modes of Worship, to which the Primitive Church was a stranger; and they obtrude upon us a company of ancient ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selete Ceremonies and Observances, as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick proofs of their Antiquity, that so all people might come over to them as the true Asserters of the most ancient and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Verities: But that we may take of these and the like pretences, we will examine some of their pleas which they use in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling of the simple and credulous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: First, they say they have the name of Catholicks, which was alwayes espoused by the Ancient Orthodox Church, and brag with it, as if it were as proper and applicable to them as risibility to a man; they are just like <hi>Thrasillus</hi> (of whom <hi>Elian</hi> tells us) who being vitiated in his Intellectuals, thought all the Ships that came into the Harbour were his own, and at their approach rejoyced as if the chief Traffick of the <hi>Indies</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to him; so the Papists crow with the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:199330:33"/> word Catholick, as if it entirely belonged to them and their party, but we must consider that every one that espouses a Name is not really so as the name importeth. <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> stiled himself the great power of God, but he was only a petty Magician for all that: <hi>Alexander</hi> gave it out that he was the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but he was mortal, and the wound which he got in a battel shortly after convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him of his folly: The <hi>Jews</hi> had many pretended Messiahs who vaunted they would do great things in order to the restitution of <hi>Israel,</hi> as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Theudas</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Acts of the Apostles) then they had <hi>Benthodad,</hi> then <hi>Moses</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> then the King of <hi>Thabor,</hi> then <hi>David Elroy;</hi> but they all proved Impostors, as the event shewed. And <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth notwithstanding the state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inscription of <hi>Paulo-quinto, Vice-Deo,</hi> that is, <hi>Paul the Fifth the Vice-God,</hi> yet wise men looked upon him as an ordinary Bishop for all this swelling appellation; for indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny assume names of Grandeur and Dignity, and others out of flattery fasten them upon them, and yet the persons remain still in the same predicament and state they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but every Sophister can detect that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious way of reasoning, and shew that <hi>à no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ad rem non valet consequentia, that from the name to the thing is a lame, and oftentimes an untrue consequence;</hi> but the Papists in this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:199330:34"/> particular imitate <hi>Jacob</hi> who got on his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Esau</hi>'s Garments, and so came to his aged Father <hi>Isaac</hi> and got the blessing: thus they cloath themselves with the specious Titles of Catholick and holy Church, thinking upon this account to have the blessing and primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture. But suppose a man should get ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's testimonial, and come and shew it to a Superiour, surely it would be look'd on as a trick and piece of gross collusion; so God will own none for true Catholicks but those who walk according to the Doctrines of the true Church, which is founded upon the Foundation of the Prophets and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Christ being himself the chief Corner-stone.</p>
                  <p>But let us consider further, that the greatest Hereticks have called themselves Catholicks, and inscribed most glorious Titles upon the most damnable assertions; the <hi>Arians</hi> said they were the only Catholicks, and called the other Orthodox Christians <hi>Homousians,</hi> and <hi>Athanasians;</hi> thus in like manner did the Novatians and Donatists, if we consult History, <hi>Manichaeus</hi> writ himself <hi>Apostolus Jesu Christi, an Apostle of Jesus Christ,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi> Hereticks bragged, <hi>nos rectâ fide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedimus, we walk in the right faith; Celsus</hi> gave his defence of Paganism this Character, The Word of Truth: and seldom do we meet with a Heretick but assumes great swelling
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:199330:34"/> Titles, and labours to varnish over his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Doctrines with the garish paint of Truth and Purity, and if names make Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles then they may easily be inserted in the Catalogue. True Religion looks not at mere outsides, terms and titles, at the form and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Cup, but what is within it, and a genuine Christian is not so because men thus nominate him,<note place="margin">Ille est verus &amp; Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus Catholicus qui veritatem Dei qui Ecclesiam qui Corpus Christi dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, qui divinae Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioni, qui Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae Fidei nihil prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit, non hominis Cujuspiam authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, non am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> but because he walks in obedience to that Universal Doctrine of Christ, which the Saints in all Ages have assented to; thus <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> tells us, that he is a true and undoubted Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, who loves the truth of God, the Church the body of Christ, who does not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem or prefer any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Divine Religion, and the Catholick Faith, not any man's Authority, Wit, Eloquence or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy: And we must take this for granted, that as the calling of Jesus Christ, a man glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and a Wine-bibber, a Friend of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners, a Confederate with <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,</hi> as it did him no harm, nor ever stained his blessed and divine purity; so our stiling our selves Catholicks or Cathatists, or Saints will avail us nothing, except we add to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:199330:35"/> name the thing, and to the form the power of godliness.</p>
                  <p>And if yet they will be so imprudent as to make a noise with Roman Catholick, as if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> infused Catholism into other places (as some of them say) let them know that we account this as trifling, childish and nonsensical, to pair a particular and universal together, as the plowing with an Oxe or an Ass, a pretty Wedding of contradictions by the Pope's Omnipotent Licence, which things will easily sue out a just Divorce in any Court of Judicature, where Reason and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity may give a free Vote and a Definitive Sentence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another Plea of theirs is this, the old Succession of Pastors, of Popes, for they tell the World that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> and was made by Christ the Head of the Church, and he delegated this power to his Successours to be the Head of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church in future Ages, and they say that from the said Saint <hi>Peter</hi> they have a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Series or Succession of Pastors, which no Church but they can shew, therefore they are in the right, and 'tis safest to be of their Communion.</p>
                  <p>But first we have Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against this Assertion,<note place="margin">Epiphan. <hi>27.</hi> Heres. advers.

                  <p>But suppose that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sat in the Chair there, they stumble in the very threshold, for they are at difference as to his Successours, and the Ancients themselves are divided, for whosoever reads <hi>Irenaeus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius, Optatus,</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:199330:36"/> succeed, and if they be uncertain in the first Series or Order of Succession, why may we not conclude the like failures in other Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, especially if we consider again that there have been so many Schisms in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, that 'tis a difficult thing to find a true and a right Succession; for by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Adversaries there has been no less than twenty six Schisms in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, some of them lasting for a long time: And not only so, but two or three Popes have been at once, as in that great Schism in the thirteenth Century, when there was <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Twelfth, <hi>Benedict</hi> the Thirteenth, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Fifth, and questionless all these Competitours pretended a due and a regular Election, Nomination or some right to the Dignity. And as for these Schisms they hapned very early, and continued long; the first began in the year 253. when <hi>Novatianus</hi> stood up as an <hi>Anti</hi>-Pope against <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and these frequent Schisms held on till the year 1439. when <hi>Felix</hi> was Competitour with <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth; and further their Succession may be proved not to be so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar if we take notice of the Controversie which has been amongst several of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning Pope <hi>Joan</hi> or <hi>John</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Onuphrius, Bellarmine, Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,</hi> do look upon such a person as a thing altogether vain and fabulous, although
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:199330:36"/> there be a cloud of witnesses that do attest the certainty of the thing, as <hi>Platina</hi> the keeper of the Library in the <hi>Vatican, Theodericus de Niem</hi> one of the Popes Secretaries, <hi>Trithemius</hi> the Abbot, <hi>Caranza</hi> that writ the sum of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, <hi>Rantius, Jacobus, Bergomensis, Mantuan,</hi> and several other Historians, who have in express terms recorded the Truth of this Story; besides the Monument of the aforesaid person was to be seen in <hi>Rome</hi> it self in the time of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, and another at <hi>Siena</hi> thrown down by the command of <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, with the assistance of <hi>Baronius,</hi> and whosoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires further satisfaction in the premises, I remit him to the Learned Dialogue of our own Country-man Mr. <hi>Alexander Cook,</hi> wherein he manifestly proves against all the surmises and objections made to the contrary, that there was a Woman called <hi>Joan</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> about two years and odd moneths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the time of <hi>Lotharius, Anno</hi> 860. Now if there be such a difference in the finding out such an one as this <hi>John</hi> the Eighth, may we not rationally conclude there may be strange miscarriages as to other Successions, which might be evidently demonstrated, if it were worth my pains, and the Readers trouble. Moreover let us deal with the Romanists ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own principles, which if we do we shall truly shew that neither they nor we can certainly tell whether they have a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:199330:37"/> right Priest or consequently a right Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any degree, for, according to their own conclusions, to the making up of Sacraments there must go the intention of the Priest; now suppose that when this or any other Pope was made a Priest,<note place="margin">Concil. Trident. Sess. <hi>7.</hi> Cant.</note> if the ordainer had not in that juncture of time a right intention, then there was (if not a nullity) yet a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiveness in that Order and Sacrament, and consequently the ordained was more or less under the efficacy of that Mystery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested more or less with a right mission or authoritativeness.</p>
                  <p>Now they do not know the intentions of hundreds of Ordainers in their Church, and so cannot tell whether the ordained partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of that indelible character conferred by Holy Orders, except they did know the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of men's hearts, and the internal conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of the mind with the outward impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands: And so it follows that no Pope or Priest of theirs can be satisfied in his Call or Mission, except they got a Testimonial of the Bishop that ordained, that his intention was right, pertinent, and correspondent to the institution, which I suppose they have not, and so 'tis very doubtful whether they have at any time a legal Ministery, or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Succession.</p>
                  <p>But more to the purpose, a local or a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:199330:37"/> Succession from the Apostles is nothing, unless their be a doctrinal too, and that is the main Succession, when men in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practices are just and strict imitators of Christ and his Disciples: The Mariners at Sea of old had this observation, that if both <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> appeared, it was a good <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of a prosperous Voyage, but if one of them singly shewed himself they judged it fatal; so if those that are to stear and guide the Ship of the Church, can show a personal and a doctrinal succession from the Apostles, then we may comfortably hope that the Church having such Pilots will safely arrive at the Cape of good hope, and the desirable port of happiness and felicity; whereas on the contrary if these Spiritual Guides shall boast of an affinity with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet in their Doctrines and Sermons broach things directly contrary to these Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Determinations, 'tis to be feared that the Vessel of the Church will be in danger of Shipwrack, and splitting it self upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive Rock of humane follies and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; therefore in the making up of a right Succession from Christ and his Apostles, there must be a doctrinal agreement, otherwise Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession without Truth is <hi>Vetustas erroris, a piece of erroneous Antiquity,</hi> as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> observes, so <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us it is our duty to adhere to those who keep the Apostles

                  <p>For the Papists themselves know that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus</hi> was an Arch-heretick, and yet he was Successor to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Church was judged irregular in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things and was excommunicated by <hi>Victor,</hi> and yet they plead a Succession from Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by whose prayers <hi>Arius</hi> was removed: So that Succession of Pastors without Succession of Doctrine is vain and frivolous, and as the <hi>Romans</hi> would not allow the Son of <hi>Scipio</hi> to wear a Ring with his Father's Picture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was debauched and did not imitate his Father's Virtues, so no more do we allow
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:199330:38"/> the Papists a right Succession from Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apostles, except they did embrace Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Truths and the Evangelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
                  <p>Another Plea of the Papists is this, they say they have the old Mass which we have not, and this Mass they tell us is the Host, or unbloody propitiatory Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, offered up by a Priest as a pleasing Sacrifice to Almighty God, for the Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sins for the quick and the dead; and this they say they have for a long time been in the possession of, which we of the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion have not.</p>
                  <p>As for Mass we must first consider the name, and we find the Scripture silent as to the mentioning any such word, neither was it ever used by Christ or his Apostles; only an ignorant popish Priest by good luck found it in a Postscript, <hi>Missa fuit haec Epistola:</hi> As to the beginning and rise of it, the Learned give us this account, In the <hi>Greek</hi> Church when the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was ended they sang the Song of <hi>Simeon, Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, &amp;c.</hi> and because the people after it were to break up the Assembly, it was called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Hence it was that the whole Service from the beginning of it till the time the Hearers were dismissed, came to be called <hi>Missa Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumenorum,</hi> as that which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist was called <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su fidelium</hi> the Mass of Believers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none but they were present at it.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:199330:39"/> to Christ's Institutions by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread and the drinking of Wine, <hi>they shew forth the Lord's death till he come,</hi> and we know no Sacrifice here but what is Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistical and gratulatory, whereby the Church gives unfeigned thanks to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God for the Redemption of the World by the Blood of the immaculate Lamb Jesus Christ, but that here is a real propitiatory sacrifice we deny.</p>
                  <p>For first all expiatory sacrifices being typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and figurative of the great sacrifice of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, had their completion and dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when he through the eternal spirit offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself up to God, <hi>as a Lamb without spot or blemish,</hi> see <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this sacrifice of Christ being once offered 'tis no more to be repeated, there was vertue enough in that one act and no need of reiteration, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 27. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many,</hi> where the Holy Ghost lays an <hi>Emphasis</hi> upon the singularity or one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ's sacrifice, as comprehending all the ends for which it was intended, and so no need of a repetition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all expiatory sacrifices required the shedding of blood, the killing of some living creature, so Christ our sacrifice was slain, and the ninth of <hi>Heb.</hi> 22. <hi>without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood was no remission of sins;</hi> now
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:199330:40"/> here is no shedding of blood in the Mass; for <hi>Christus</hi> (as they say) <hi>incruentè immolatur,</hi> 'tis an unbloody sacrifice which is contradictory to the notion of all expiatory Rites whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Christ upon the Cross cryed out <hi>'tis finished,</hi> that is, that the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was compleated by the sacrificing of himself, and so God's Justice appeased, and man put into a state of reconciliation; but now if it be needful every day for a Priest to offer up a propitiatory sacrifice for the quick and the dead, then the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was not finished, but was to be working out by piece-meal in all the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages of the Gospel; and thus they will rather give a manifest lie to Jesus Christ, and openly contradict his affirmation, than abjure their beloved Idol.</p>
                  <p>Therefore instead of the Mass we have the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, a Holy Rite according to Christ's Institution, as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the sacrifice of the death of Christ that blessed Victime, who once offered up himself; and no sacrifice know we of here but that gratulatory one of praise and thanksgiving: Hence we leave them to their own superstitions to worship a breaden God, whereby they are a scorn and reproach to <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and so lay stumbling blocks in the way of their conversion.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:199330:40"/>
                  <p>Another plea of the Romanists is this, they say all the Ancients are on their side; and here they make a flourish and affirm that the Holy Apostles, the blessed Martyrs, the glorious Confessors, the Learned Fathers, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctors all teach as they do; and that the Protestants follow their own private Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, scorn Antiquity, dote on Novelty, and have never a Patron for their new Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Now alas what shall we do, if the case be as they pretend, 'twere the best to pack away to <hi>Rome,</hi> to crave Absolution for our long espoused Schism and Heresie, to get the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of the Holy Father, and to enter the Lists of their Communion: But I make this Remonstrance both for my self and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Protestants, that our Writers have fully shown, and yet we can make it appear, that the whole current of Antiquity runs our way, and their own <hi>Cassander</hi> could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that as to Marriage, the Lord's Supper, and several other controverted things betwixt them and us, that anciently they were practised according as they are in use in the Reformed Churches; and for the voluminous Writings of the Fathers, those who have been most studied in them, such as Bishop <hi>Jewel, Feild, Whitaker, Willet,</hi> Bishop <hi>Laud, Birbeck,</hi> and several others have shewed that the Fathers unanimously have given their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:199330:41"/> for us; so that 'tis needless to quote Authorities: but however that the ordinary Reader may have something by him to stop the reproachful mouth of a scandalizing Priest or Jesuit, I shall not think much to set down a few remarkable testimonies out of the Ancient Fathers, which may be as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny smooth Stones taken out of the Brook <hi>Kidron,</hi> to throw at these vaunting <hi>Goliahs who desie the Armies of</hi> Israel.</p>
                  <p>And first for the Popes Primacy, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Book <hi>de Ʋnitate Ecclesiae,</hi>

                  <p>Thus we have brought in these several Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, which sufficiently demonstrate that this Plea of theirs is nothing but a false insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, and the Fathers have not given in Evidence according to their Tenents and Surmises, and so their Assertion in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is a gross and manifest untruth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, which by hundreds of other Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be confirmed if it were needful
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:199330:44"/> and pertinent to my business, which is not to meddle so much with polemical and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Points, as to perswade that which has relation to conversation and practice.</p>
                  <p>Another Plea of theirs is the continuance of Miracles in their Church, whereby 'tis (as they say) evidenced from Heaven to be the true Catholick Church, and this is one of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Notes; and I had taken a little pains in showing their incredible, ridiculous, irrational fooleries in the premises, both from the Legend and other of their approved Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but it is so learnedly and satisfactorily done already by the Reverend and never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be honoured Doctor <hi>Edward Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> that I may spare my pains in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, referring the Reader to that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Treatise of his, Entituled, <hi>A Discourse in the Vindication of the Protestants Grounds of Faith, and an Enquiry into the Miracles of the Roman Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now after their Pleas behold their numerous Superstitions, a <hi>Babel</hi> and Rapso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of confusion, which never entred into the heart of the blessed Jesus, or were practised by him or his Disciples.</p>
                  <p>And first come to the Lord's Supper, the Mass (as they call it:) Their must be a stately Stone-Altar, abundance of Trinkets; then comes the Priest with a multitude of Conges, Crossings, Kissings, Adorations, Exaltations,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:199330:45"/> and other Antick Gestures, that an ignorant person would believe either he were acting the part of a Conjurer or a Jugler, or else were to manage a company of Puppets to make the Spectators some pretty pastime or diversion.</p>
                  <p>Go we from hence to Baptism, where we shall find a numerous company of Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Priest must use Salt, and that signifies spiritual seasoning forsooth; it is a wonder they did not add a little Pepper too, that so the Ceremony might have been more signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant.</p>
                  <p>Cream was another thing in use, some say because it was a little too phlegmatick, they have omitted it, and I much wonder at it; for, me thinks, it might have been of notable use in this piece of spiritual Cookery.</p>
                  <p>Then comes in Spittle: Well, if it be fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spittle, I have heard Old Women say it is Medicinal; but King <hi>Jame</hi>'s Mother spoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Ecclesiastical Rite, when she said she would have never a pocky Priest of them all to spit in her Child's Mouth.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes again you shall see them light abundance of Candles on fair day light, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on the day of Purification in honour of the Blessed Virgin; just as the Heathens did at the same time in honour of <hi>Proserpina,</hi> which discovers nothing more than the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and blindness of their understandings, who are ready to imitate the purblind Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles sitting in darkness and under the region of the shadow of death.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes you shall find them at a rare piece of spiritual Pageantry, and that is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Bells, which is done with many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and the reading of several <hi>Psalms,</hi> and the Bells must forsooth have Godfathers and Godmothers, who promise, I suppose, not that they shall keep the Faith, but time and tune, and they give them Christian Names; I remember there is <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran, Tom</hi> of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> and that you may not think but there be Females also, in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s dayes there was a great Bell of <hi>Christ Church</hi> called <hi>Mary</hi> solemnly baptized; and if this be not done, the Papist thinks it can never give a Canonical sound, nor fright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

                  <p>Again, you shall find the Pope sending consecrated Roses to Kings and Princes, though made in Lent, yet better than those that grow in <hi>June;</hi> these are sent only to his Holinesse's special Friends, and though they neither have any sweet smell, or are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative as the natural, yet under them are comprehended rare Catholick Virtues and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresies, which Hereticks are not fit to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
                  <p>The Pope also sends out hallowed Flags and Banners, to those that fight as he would have them, making the credulous believe, that by virtue of these the Pope's Champion shall become one of the inchanted Knights, absolutely invincible, and so he may assault and encounter Lions, Dragons, Mormors, Wind-mills, and I know not what.</p>
                  <p>But the most notable and remarkable piece of Foolery and Idolatry was that of the Rood, acted by Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which was (as Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> tells us) in this manner:<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Reformal Reign of Queen <hi>Mary, pag.</hi> 32.</note> They made a fair I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of our Saviour (for this they call the Rood) and they brought it most devoutly into Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Quire, and laid it upon the Pavement, (for it was as many of the like are a little gowty in the feet, and could not stand) then they said
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:199330:47"/> divers prayers over it (but I suppose it scarce said <hi>Amen▪</hi>) then they anointed it with oyl, very proper (for it may be this might supple the stiff and inflexible joynts;) then they crept to it, most fit for it could not come to them; and if the Mountain will not come to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> then let him go to the Mountain; then they kissed it, well, every one as he likes, and then they got cords, not to tie him as the <hi>Tyrians</hi> did their gods, (for their was no danger of starting) but to draw him up, and then all the Quire sung <hi>Te Deum:</hi> O a joyful sight! and here they set him to keep Centry, and he stirred not for three or four cold Winters, till Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came and gave him a dismission, and bid him go warm himself at the fire which was performed.</p>
                  <p>Now I appeal to an imprejudiced Reader, if that the 44. of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> where God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of <hi>Israel,</hi> that they worshipped the stock of a Tree, composed by Smiths and Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the shape and representation of an Idol God, do not as much strike at these Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Romanists, as ever it did against the superstitious Israelites, &amp; shall they escape the fury of the divine threatnings any more than they; no surely, for God is as jealous of his glory now as ever he was in the dayes of old.</p>
                  <p>But now I shall pass these gaudy trifles and obtruded observances, which have nothing of the superscription of <hi>Caesar,</hi> which these like
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:199330:47"/> their Brethren the Pharisees of old lay so much stress upon, as if they were the very soul and life of Religion; and if any seem to oppose them in these ridiculous practises, they pour out whole Floods of Curses and Anathemaes upon him, as if he made it his business to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne the Lord Jesus, and evacuate the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Salvation; and let me entreat all pious souls to hold fast their Profession against such delusory Pleas and ceremonious Customs, by which these false Teachers delude the simple: for truly they cause the ignorant to be much like the famous Mathematician <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who when at the sacking of <hi>Syracuse</hi> he should have endeavoured the preservation of himself and Family, he busied himself with making Circles in the Dust, and so was slain by a Souldier; thus they cause the unwary multitude to spend their time in simple im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed fooleries, and ceremonious trifles, white Faith in Christ, repentance towards God, and other Christian virtues and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises are neglected, and so their eternal safety is much endangered; be we therefore so wise as to follow the steps of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, those Infallible Directors, leaving these blind Guides and their Followers who are like to fall into the Ditch, seeing they will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully shut their eyes against the light of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

                     <hi>Cons.</hi> 1. But let us hold fast our Profession against these; considering, That after Jesus Christ there is not to be another Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to matter of Doctrine, and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mind of God: Indeed in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cases, as about Murder, special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, strange Prognosticks, God is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:199330:49"/> to reveal himself in a miraculous manner, and many Saints have been Prophetical; but a Revelation as to the setting up of a new Canon of Scripture after Christ is not to be expected. The Jewish Doctors tell us, that after <hi>Haggai, Zechariah</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi> were dead, the Holy Ghost ascended into Heaven and departed from Israel, and all extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ways of Gods Revelation ceased, save only the daughter of a voice, or a voice that came with Thunder, which was a presignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that true Voice or Eternal Word, who was to be the Interpreter of his Fathers Will, whom we are to hearken to; and all other Prophetical Lights, and Revelations or Communications of God's Will, were to yield to that of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For 'tis supposed, that in the Transfiguration of Christ,<note place="margin">Matth. 17.3.</note> when <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> appeared to him, they both struck sail to Christ and submitted to his Oeconomy, <hi>Moses</hi> for the Law,<note place="margin">☜</note> and <hi>Elias</hi> for the Prophets; as if all their Oracles were completed in him, and were as so many Glimmerings and borrowed Beams from this Sun of Righteousness; and a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bid, <hi>Hear him,</hi> who was to be chief and principal Prolocutor.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis further to be considered, that what the Lord Jesus has delivered, is to be authentick Canon for the last dayes; so

                     <hi>Heb.</hi> Chap. 1.

'tis called <hi>the everlasting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> as not to give way to any other intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Doctrine (as that of <hi>Moses</hi> did) but to remain as the standing Rule by which God will guide his Church, till Time acknowledge its period, and Eternity take place; upon this account <hi>Tertullian</hi> was bold to affirm that we need not employ our time in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious searches after Truth,<note place="margin">Nobis curiositate non opus est post Jesum Christum, <hi>Tertul. de praescrip. advers.

                     </note> since Christ has done it to our hands. Therefore if any will come, and with <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretend great Revelations from the Angel <hi>Gabriel;</hi> with Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> shall talk of, converse with Spirits and strange discoveries; or with <hi>H.

For men to neglect the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scripture for these Suggestions it much reflects upon the Wisdom and Goodness of God, as if he had given us some incomplete and defective Light, not able to guide our feet in the ways of Truth and Peace; as if the Father of Lights had vouchsafed us only a dark Lantern to walk by, and the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:199330:50"/> Sun of Righteousness afforded us an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Beam, and the Law which is a Lamp, were only an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> a glaring uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Meteor, which could not direct the clouded and benighted Soul; and so it would make God to leave the sons of men as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Travellers out of their Rode without the benefit of a comfortable Guide, except some sudden irradiations now and then break in, which are contingent and arbitrary, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pleasure of the expected Spirit; but this cannot be presumed; for the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deals benignly and graciously with the sons of men, and gives them a perfect Law, full Directions, and bids them walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and not to be <hi>as the horse and mule in whom there is no understanding.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Considerat.</hi> 3. Again, by adhering to new Revelations, we seem to invalidate two great Offices of Jesus Christ; his Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as if he had kept back something of the mind of God, as if he had fed our souls with some small Clusters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and left the Vintage behind; as if he would only let us see our Beloved through the Lattice, and keep the open manifestations behind to be experienced in extatical Visions and Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; as if he had only taught us the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, and Revelations were to make us Perfectionists; whereas we are plainly told, Christ <hi>brought Life and Immortality to light
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:199330:51"/> by the Gospel,</hi> that <hi>the Scriptures are able to make us wise to salvation,</hi> and <hi>the man of God perfect, thoroughly furnished to every good work.</hi> Besides this strikes at the Kingly Office of Jesus Christ, as if the Laws of this King were dark, cloudy, Enigmatical, as if the Smoke of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> clove to the Doctrine delivered by Christ on the Mount, as if he exacted strict obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and had given us but weak Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Duty; this would make our blessed Saviour a rigorous Tyrant, rather than any thing else: whereas if we rightly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Lord Jesus in the making of Gospel-laws, has done as much as can be required of any good King or Law-giver whatsoever; for we are told that to the making of all good Laws there be these requisites. 1. There is to be <hi>Intentio boni communis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☞</note> a looking at the general good and welfare of the people for whom the Laws and Institutions are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; so the blessed Jesus ordered all his Laws, that they might be subservient not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the great End of God's Glory, but also of our Salvation; and all his aim in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulging of these excellent Statutes was, that man might perfect Holiness here, in order to Happiness and Felicity hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the making of a Law there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Judicium</hi> or <hi>Prudentia Architectonica,</hi> as they usually phrase it; that is, much Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence in order to the adapting
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:199330:51"/> of Commands according to the Genius and Temperature of the people; so Jesus Christ who is the Wisdom of his Father, has framed these Evangelical Laws so prudently, that they have a natural tendency not only to our future Bliss, but our temporal Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and ordinarily he that disobeys these Precepts, not only violates the holy Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heaven, but trespasses even upon his own Conveniences, as might be shown at large.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is required the <hi>Sigillum,</hi> the <hi>Seal</hi> or Ratification of all, the Ordainment or fix'd Resolution of the King that such and such a thing shall be binding and obligatory; so we find in the Gospel the <hi>Volumus</hi> or <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuimus,</hi> the will and pleasure and positive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Law-giver. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth shall be saved, he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, to the making of a Law there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>Vox Tubae,</hi> the Proclamation of that Law, that every one may be warned of the Law-giver's Mind and his own Duty: so
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:199330:52"/> Christ has sent out his Ministers, <hi>Preco's</hi> and Ambassadors, who entreat us to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto God: Thus he has appointed in the Church some Pastors, Teachers, Evangelists, in all the Centuries since his blessed Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to reveal the Truth to the dim-sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> that so ignorance might not eternally blind them. Now when Christ has taken all this pains, for a Revelation to be superinduced, directly contrary to these ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and promulgated Laws of Christ, it must needs be a great violation of his Kingly Office, when another shall enforce other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions than were proposed by the rightful Prince: For would not his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> take it as a great Usurpation of his just Rights, if <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> Pope or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, should obtrude their Laws upon the English Natives? So those that bring in their fanciful and Enthusiastick Notions against the settled Decrees of the Lord Jesus, we cannot chuse but look upon them as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of his Royalty, and so enemies to <hi>Caesar.</hi>

                  <p>Well, but another, full of the Spirit as he thought, comes to the aforesaid Seaman, and commands him in the name of Almighty God to carry him beyond Sea, and withal in the name of God promises him a safe and a pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Voyage.

Not many Leagues were they gone, but on a sudden a great Storm arises, the Waves beat, all fear present death; they tell this Prophet that he had prophesied lyes to them in the name of the Lord, that they were never in such danget (as the man protested to me) concluded he was another <hi>Jonah:</hi> after much labour and tugging they recovered <hi>Tinmouth</hi>-Harbour again, turned out the lying Prophet, hoised up sail the next fair wind, and had a prosperous Voyage.</p>
                  <p>Another I might add, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>William Pearl</hi> of <hi>Crake</hi> in <hi>York-shire</hi> a Quaker came to me in the year 1659 a (as I remember) and he told me God had plainly revealed it unto him, that I and all other Priests in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should now go down, for our time of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall was come, with many such like Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I told him that I did believe he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the Spirit of God and was an Impostor,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:199330:53"/> and whether he were an inspired man or no by the true unerring Spirit, the Event did sufficiently declare. Therefore those that run after these Revelations and lay stress upon them, oftentimes give the lye to the good Spirit of God, making themselves to be taught and instructed by it, whenas the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and their own credulous hearts hurry them on to these delusions: to whom we may apply that in the 14. of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Vers. 14. <hi>They prophesie lyes in my name, I have not sent them, neither did I command them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spake I unto them; but they prophesie unto you a false vision and divination, a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own hearts;</hi> and the Judgment follows, which I wish they would consider.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They make the Spirit guilty of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: And this appears, if we consider, that the Scriptures are the inditement of the holy Ghost; for the Prophets <hi>of old spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> declares, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Now if the same ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost spake in the Four Evangelists, in St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apostles, and they have left it to us upon record in the sacred Oracles, that the Church shall use Baptism, Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Ordination, publick Assemblies and other Christian Dutyes there inserted, for an Enthusiast to come up publickly and declare that Baptism is childish sprinkling, the Lord's
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:199330:54"/> Supper a carnall Ordinance, Ordination by man insignificant (which I have too often heard) and protest God has revealed this to them: Does it not make the Spirit disagree with it self, speaking one thing in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> another thing in these upstart Prophets, and so guilty of Contradictions, which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the territories of Blasphemy; which all sober Christians should loath and abhor, as a thing highly wicked and Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical.</p>
                  <p>Again, these Revelations, if we rest upon them, leave Christians upon the greatest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty imaginable, for they take away the <hi>Basis</hi> and Foundation of our Faith. In the holy Scriptures we find solid substantial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Verities, all ratified and confirmed by the finger of God in the operation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that so they might be credible and gain approbation; these are a good Bottom or <hi>Substratum</hi> for us to fix our Belief upon, and the Scripture bids us rest here; and if an Angel should come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Galat. 1.8.</note> and preach Doctrines contrary to these settled Truths, we are to set him away with an <hi>Anathema</hi> and Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now these Enthusiasms and Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are so various, uncertain, contradictory, that the Soul, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, can find no place for the sole of her foot to rest on, till she retire to the Scripture-Ark. Thus you
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:199330:54"/> shall see one thing revealed to day, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other pretends a brighter Beam, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that is contradicted: As in the case con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, St. <hi>Katharine,</hi> a holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, declared it was revealed to her, that the Mother of our Lord was conceived in sin, as we are; but St. <hi>Briget,</hi> another Saint in the Romish Church, told a Story quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz.</hi> That she had a Revelation that she was not conceived in sin, but was privileged from that hereditary pollution; thus
<q>Scinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgus:</q> The Soul knows not to what to give assent and credence, but is tossed with doubts and anxieties betwixt <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis,</hi> and is in danger of making shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience. Therefore, Christian, trust not thy Soul with those Vanities, but submit to the Guidance of the good Word of God, this <hi>sure word of Prophecy;</hi> mind none of those uncertain, though so much applauded, discoveries; but as our blessed Saviour decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the old Wine was the best, so the old Wine of Scripture is the best and most cherishing; whereas the new Wine, new Phansies, Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Revelations are windy, flatulent, puffing men up, making them high, swelling, vain-glorious, Pharisaical, and what not? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:199330:55"/> for fear of being deceived, let the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary weigh all, the Oracles of God decide all, the Rule of God Word be the Square of all thy actions, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Touch-stone of all thy espoused Doctrines; as for Revelations they are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, that upon them at least I fear thou wilt be forced to write with <hi>Solomon, Vanity of vanities all is vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Considerat.</hi> 5. Further let us observe, that resting upon Revelations makes us rather like the Heathens and superstitious Papists, than true Christians; for of old those that attended the Gentile Oracles were exstatick, as the Pythoness of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and others, and then they gave out strange enigmatical and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Responses; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> made use of his Paralytick fits, and pretended that then God revealed to him the Mysteries of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and that at other times he had converse with the Angel <hi>Gabriel. Licurgus</hi> pretended <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos</hi> revealed to him the Laws he brought the Lacedemonians; <hi>Meno</hi> had his from <hi>Mercury</hi> which he gave to the Egyptians. <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> said the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess <hi>Egeria</hi> taught him the Roman Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>Zaleucus</hi> feigned that he had corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with <hi>Minerva,</hi> which taught him those Statutes which he imposed upon the Locrians.</p>
                  <p>And the most most of the Roman Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:199330:55"/> especially Purgatory, are founded upon such like Revelations; abundance of such like you may find in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Dialogues, in the Legend, <hi>in Vitis Patrum,</hi> in the Books of <hi>Marcus Maurulus</hi> dedicated to the Jesuits, comprehending memorable actions and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; there we find that it was revealed to <hi>Odilo,</hi> that Prayers and Supplications for the Dead were very necessary and advantageous, and a Day was appointed for such Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morations, <hi>viz.</hi> the day after the Feast of <hi>All Saints,</hi> still continued in the Roman Church; and afterwards Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Eldebert</hi> a Monk, and told him, that by the Prayers of <hi>Odilo</hi> he was released out of Purgatory. ('Tis a wonder that the Pope who helps others out could not do the feat for himself.)</p>
                  <p>And if you will peruse a Book styled the Moral Practices of the Jesuits, set out by the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 379.</note> there you will find that this is one of their Maxims, That 'tis the Perfection of a Christian to keep himself indifferent to what God shall reveal, and not to determine himself to what is revealed in the Gospel, a rare Position! They further maintain, That a professed Friar may dispense with his Vow upon account of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; Pure Trouts!<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 237.</note> what words shall hold
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:199330:56"/> them? Not Scriptures, not Vows. If the Jesuits have a strong impulse or suggestion to kill Kings, to raise Conspiracies or Rebellions, or promote as great wickedness as ever the Devil can prompt them to, they must gird up their loyns and to it; a Revelation is warrant enough, though God and Christ have threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Crime with no less then eternal and irreversible damnation. In the same Book we are told, how a Jesuite pretended to a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matron, that God had revealed it to him that he should privately take her to wife, which was accordingly believed; and so a Revelation was the best Spokesman and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick to win his Mistress. Nay many of their Orders have had their rise and progress from these things, especially the Order of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits: for we read that <hi>Ignatius</hi> going to <hi>Rome,</hi> in order to the erecting of this Society, had a Vision wherein God appeared to him and recommended him and his two associates to Jesus Christ, and the Lord Jesus assured him that he would assist him, and that all should go well with him at <hi>Rome,</hi> which proved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Therefore good Christian who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, <hi>to the Law and to the Testimony,</hi> and <hi>let not the book of the Law depart from thee,</hi> but take advice there, as to all thy spiritual Enterprizes. Let Heathens and Papists feed upon Dreams and Phancies, but the good Christian Palate should relish no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:199330:56"/> but the Word of Truth, the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Manna; this is the proper wholesom nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing food for our immortal Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Considerat.</hi> 6. Lastly these pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations lay us open to all the delusions of Satan, 'tis his great cunning to draw us from the good Old Way, that being as so many bewildred Travellers we may follow every Light presented to us, causing us to believe we are at <hi>Dothan</hi> when we are at <hi>Samaria,</hi> at <hi>Sion</hi> when we are at <hi>Sodom,</hi> at <hi>Bethel</hi> when we are at the Altar of the god of <hi>Ekron.</hi> 'Tis reported of some savage people that border upon the Sea-costs, to promote their gain they make fires in the night upon the clifts of some dangerous Rocks, on purpose to draw thither unwary Mariners, who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find an harbour, meet with an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected shipwrack; so the Devil to satisfie his envy, and to enrich himself with the ruines of our immortal Souls, sets out these false Beacons of pretended Revelations, which the simple Multitude embracing as so many divine Rayes, are miserably led to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Gulf of eternal ruine.</p>
                  <p>This piece of policy Satan made use of very early in the beginning of the Third Century, when <hi>Montanus</hi> and his two Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Prisca</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> bragged of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acquaintance with God, converses with Angels, great Impulses and Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:199330:57"/> with whose Enchantments <hi>Tertullian</hi> himself was so deluded, that in after-times he got the brand of an Heretick by some: and the Devil prompted them to such horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedness upon the account of divine perswasions, that some of them ended their days in a Halter, being instigated so to do by the Spirit of Error, that they might, as 'twas pretended, sooner take possession of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Mansions. More especially that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Story recorded by <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Lib. <hi>5.</hi> Cap. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> of one <hi>Theodotus</hi> a Montanist, is not to be pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, who had a Vision that he should be taken up into Heaven as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and by a kind of Diabolical power suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be hoised up into the Air, but was let fall again by this Prince of the Air, and so miserably ended his wretched life.</p>
                  <p>And those great Hereticks in <hi>Germany</hi> were all for these Enthusiastical Dreams and Visions, as may be seen at large in the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of <hi>Munster,</hi> and in the Stories of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden, David George, Herman</hi> the Cobler, and others; more particularly in <hi>Switzerland</hi> there was one <hi>Thomas Scucker</hi> by name, a great Enthusiast, that had a Revelation to cut off his Brother <hi>Leonard</hi>'s head, which he did openly with a Sword in the presence of his Parents and others; and when he was haled away to prison, he said he did nothing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:199330:57"/> but what God commanded him, and therein obeyed the Divine Power. What, I pray you, became of all that Converse with Spirits by Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> was not Delusion at the bottom of all? Though his Spirits pretended San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, yet at last they told him and his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, That it was the will of God that they should promiscuously use one anothers Wives, and seem'd to justifie it by the Example of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Did not they acquaint him as if there should be another Dispensation, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gospel, and talked strange things about Government which were but Fables? And many Grandees and Kings and Princes were cozened by him; only Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Pope looked on him as deluded, as the event proved. In later times did not two or three kill their Mother in the Moors in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi> and had a strong suggestion they could raise her to life again? Did not one Mr. <hi>Brough</hi>'s Son, who turned a Quaker, one Sunday-morning revile his own Father, who was Minister of <hi>Norton</hi> in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham?</hi> and told his Father that he was sent from God, and he was like the Apostles, that if he should touch poysonous things he should not be hurt; and moreover said, that if he put his hand into the boyling Pot upon the fire, it would not burn him; and when his Father's back was turned, he slipt up his sleeve, and put his hand into the boyling
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:199330:58"/> water, and was miserably scalded. I might add many more of this nature, whereby we may see how by adhering to these Enthusiasms and Revelations we are a prey to the Deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Souls: therefore let every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian stick close to the holy Scriptures, and not be carried away with every specious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Children in great Cities when they stray from home are oftentimes caught up and spirited away; so when we leave the Church and Scriptures, no marvel if we be a prey to the evil Spirits, who <hi>go about seeking whom th y may devour:</hi> Let us hold fast therefore the Word of Truth, and let none take this Crown from us. 'Tis said of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Crow</hi> a Seaman, that when his Ship was split and all his goods lost, he saved nothing but his New Testament that he tyed about his neck, and was found swimming with it; so let us not part with the holy Scriptures, the heavenly Pole-star, the Treasury of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the displayer of Vanity, the Ballance of Equity, and the perfect Rule of Truth and Honesty.</p>

Is the stone to be blamed for running down the hill, when
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:199330:61"/> it is thrown by an impetuous hand? So if the Will of Man be superseded, and he made like a Clock or Jack, that has the weights of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and Fatality put on him, how can such an one be accounted a Trangressor? Shall we make our God do that which the Heathens scorned? The Athenians were told by <hi>Themistocles,</hi> that he knew a thing would make much for their advancement, but it was not fit to be declared to the people; the Senate bid him communicate it to <hi>Aristides,</hi> and if he approved it, they would receive it: the Counsel was to burn the Naval Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Haven-docks of the Grecians, and by this means they should be their Masters presently; <hi>Aristides</hi> tells the Senate, that the Counsel of <hi>Themistocles</hi> was profitable, but very dishonest, upon this they refused it, and charged <hi>Aristides</hi> secrecy. If they had so much uprightness and honesty as not to hurt a few Ships, shall we think that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God will make Souls, necessitate them to be immersed in vice and turpitude, and then bundle them for Hell-fire? No surely, <hi>shall not the Judge of the World do righteously?</hi> 3. It destroys the Nature of the Reasonable Creature. God has taken a great deal of pains in our curious and exact Formation, giving us those noble Faculties which he has denied the generality of his Creatures: There is the Understanding surrounded with Beams,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:199330:61"/> crowned with Light, able to comprehend in some good measure the most glorious and excellent Mysteries: There is the Will, like the Queen upon the Throne, with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as so many Handmaids attending her. And as he gives us these Endowments, so he bids us make use of them; one while he bids us <hi>consider our ways,</hi> to <hi>chuse the good and hate the evil;</hi> to <hi>fear lest a Promise being made to us of entring into rest, we come short of it;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us <hi>not to be as the horse and the mule in whom there is no understanding;</hi> complained of the Jews, that they were worse than the Stork, Crane and Swallow, and taxed <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> for not minding <hi>the time of her visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Now to what purpose have we these noble Faculties, if Destiny overswayd all? this takes away all care and solicitude, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and circumspection, deliberation and advisement, as a Privy Counseller some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times told Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed some to countenance this Opinion. That Repentance and Conversion can be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged without these internal Powers, none I suppose can imagine, and that an irresistible force should set the Wheels a going, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all without our volition or compliance, is judged by many as irrational: not that the Will can really close with the invitations of the Gospel without the assistance of Grace, yet Man still remains a free Agent and self-determining
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:199330:62"/> Creature notwithstanding all the divine aids and auxiliaries, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself in his <hi>Call to the Ʋnconverted,</hi>

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 151.</note> seems to censure such Conclusions as these that attribute all to a supernatural Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, having no regard to our own Will and Determinations.</p>
                  <p>This Fatality evacuates the Gospel and Ministry thereof, the ends of which are to inform us of our duty, and to perswade us to the practice of it; and this is done by the proposal of Rewards and Punishments, by Threatnings and Promises, in order to the Reformation of the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> But if Necessity guide all, Instruction is inavailable. What is it to inculcate Lessons to him that cannot take them out, but must necessarily write after that Copy which Fate and Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have prescribed him; all that a man should learn here is only submission to unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Decrees, patience and contentation to be hurried as the Chariot of blind For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune pleases; besides, what signifies perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? would it not be a madness to importune the Sun to have a retrograde Motion, to post backwards from <hi>Capricorn</hi> to <hi>Aries;</hi> to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Stars, not to have such ominous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; to request the Moon not to suffer her self to be eclipsed by the opake shadow of the Earth; to desire the rapid Torrent
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199330:62"/> or <hi>Euripus</hi> to turn its course, when all these things go orderly according to the Method prefixed by the great Creator? So would it not be a madness to say to the ungodly, Turn, to pray the Sinner not to do so wickedly, to brandish the Spear of Reprehension, and to bring <hi>Suada's</hi> and Promises to those that are under uncontrollable Determinations? all this will be to as little purpose as <hi>Caligula</hi> his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Moon to be his Paramour, or the Cockle-shells which he set a great Army to gather, as the spoils of the conquered Ocean.</p>
                  <p>Again, this Fatality destroys Prayer and shuts out Repentance; to what purpose is it for a man to <hi>bow his knees to the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> to desire good and deprecate evil, if all things be thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordain'd by Fortune? the good that is to come, and the evil that is to be suffer'd, will certainly present themselves without Orizons and passionate Entreaties, and so that Precept of the Gospel of <hi>praying continually</hi> would be a troublesom and insignificant Duty. Either how can that man fall upon any duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Humiliation, that overlooks his own Corruption, the propensity of his Nature to do evil, the slighted and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed helps of Heaven, and meerly eyes a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Necessity, which like an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> has led him into the Labyrinths of Sin and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness? He will not be ready to cry out, <hi>Ille
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:199330:63"/> ego qui feci, I have done very foolishly, I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and what shall I say unto thee, O thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of men;</hi> but he will rather cry out of a supreme Power and fatal Stars, which have made him take the way to <hi>Sodom</hi> and the Chambers of death.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine of Fate takes away all the Process of a Judgment: to what end shall the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty sit on his Throne, the Books be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Christ and his Assessours take their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and call the kindreds of the Earth, to answer the Interrogatories of the Gospel? all these Trials and Examinations would be as so many petty cheats and hypocritical formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if a man were a perfect Weather-cock that must turn only as the wind of Fate and Fortune blows him. It annihilates also in a great measure the torments of Hell, which are presumed to be very pungent upon the sense and consideration of mispent time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded opportunities, neglected Grace, making light of Christ; from hence proceeds that which we call the punishment of loss, the corroding and gnawing of that Worm which dies not, which as an acute sting shall torment the wicked to all Eternity. Now if it were so that a forcible Destiny (maugre all their care and industry to the contrary) had violently detruded them into these infernal Dungeons, this would take away the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Sentiments, and they would bewail
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:199330:63"/> only such a thing as a Manichean Deity, or a Planetary Influence, that had subjected them to these transcendent calamities; they would not condole their own viciousness, but cavil at an insuperable power that had plunged them into this state of Damnation. In a word, this Doctrine of necessity would totally deface a holy Conversation, and the practice of respective Duties to God and man; as it is recorded of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that he was most negligent as to the Gods and Religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances, because he was fully perswaded that all things came to pass by Fate and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny. But we might fill a Volume with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Arguments against such a nonsensical Doctrine, rather than a few Paragraphs; all that we shall further say, is only to answer that Objection founded upon <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. where it is said that Christ by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Counsel and Foreknowledge of God was deliver'd up to the Jews, and so it was impossible but that the Jews should crucifie the Son of God, to execute and bring to pass the divine <hi>Fiat</hi> and Ordination.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the several Glosses of Expositors I cannot choose but close with that Note of Mr <hi>Calvin</hi> upon these words (though I must confess in other places he seems to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a different Judgment) but here he saith,<note place="margin">Calvin. in locum.</note>

And
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:199330:64"/> whereas many lay a great stress upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of God, as if, because things cannot be otherwise than God sees them, therefore they are ready to talk of a certain Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Fate, as some more nicely determine, yet we may safely and soberly conclude, that this foresight doth not in the least necessitate to Crimes, disturb the order, method and actions of the rational Creature, or do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to our Faculties; for if God see <hi>Judas</hi> to be a Traytor and a final impenitent, he sees in like manner all the Intrigues tending that way, the covetous bent of his heart, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of gain, his base ingratitude, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things subservient in that Conspiracy; and all the assistance he has from God is no more than that of ordinary Being and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, God not forcing him beyond the bent of his natural Temper. If I look out at a window, and see a Ship violently tossed with winds, and a Rock hard by, I know by the Rules of Reason and Experience, that if she once come to dash upon the Rock, a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack will follow, yet my foresight has no causality in the Tragedy, but the boysterous winds and raging waves are mainly to blame: So it is in this case, as to God's Prescience and Man's Sin,; if he takes the way to the bottomless Pit, and dashes upon the Rocks of eternal Ruine, he may thank the Waves and Winds of his own impetuous Passions,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:199330:65"/> which have hurried him to this misery, and acquit God who <hi>is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works:</hi> For those that lay a forcing necessity upon the Prescience of God, draw undue Corollaries from God's Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Omniscience; as if because he knowing how things will be, he must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily make them so; when as we have an hundred examples from Astronomers, Mathematicians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby we can see things manifestly to happen and ensue, and yet we are no way assisting or contributing to such Productions, but they spring from the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical force and vertue of their own proper natural Causes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Christian, hold fast thy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which commands thee <hi>to work out thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling, do good, hate the appearances of evil;</hi> stand upon thy guard against thy beloved Lusts, neither embrace unlawful presented pleasures, as if God had designed thee first to sin and then to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he that says, <hi>Turn you, turn you,</hi> has not determined that thou shouldst take the broad way that leads to perdition: He that says, <hi>Why will ye die, O house of Israel,</hi> has not by an arbitrary power ordered that thou shouldst lie first in sin, and then in eternal Flames: He that hath given thee so many promises and threats, so many helps and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, so many calls and invitations, does not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:199330:65"/> secretly purpose that thou shouldst first drink iniquity with greediness, that thou mightest afterwards drink the wine of his wrath and fury for evermore. Look therefore to thy self, stand upon thy watch; Sin may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, the devil repelled, a Victory obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; beg the assistance of the Spirit of Christ, and fight the Lord's Battels, and accomplish a holy Warfare; there is no Decree, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thee, that thou shall be a Reprobate, and take up thy lodgings in mansions of Fire and Brimstone, except thou desert the Lord Jesus, and despise the Gospel of Salvation; thou servest a God that will by no means ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine thee if thou be not sinful, nor condemn thee except thou be guilty: believe his Oath when he swears he <hi>delights not in the death of a sinner,</hi> he cannot give thee a greater assurance than when he swears by his own Life and eternal Being;<note place="margin">O beatos nos quorum causà Deus jurat, O miserrimos si nec ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranti credimus, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull de poenit. cap. 4.</hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:199330:71"/> Servants standing at the Church-porch, and if he gave it them, God would take it as done to himself: upon this account he gave the best part of the little Money he had to those poor and indigent people. After three or four months they spent the remaining money they had reserved, and being necessitous, quoth the husband to the wife, I have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Directions, and have given away my goods, and yet the Christian God does not repay me; she answered, Wait with patience a little, and walk up to the Church, and see if any good may happen to thee: He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Church, and amongst the poor, but none said any thing to him, only at his coming away he found a piece of money ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ground; back he comes, and said, Dear Sister, I have done as thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandedst me, but I have no answer, only I have found one piece of money; she replyed, well, go buy us something, and God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us: To the Market he goes, and buyes a little Fish, a Loaf and some Wine, and brought them home; as the woman was a cutting up the Fish she finds in it a precious Stone; it was very bright and transparent, and they concluded to go to the Jeweller with it; the man brought it, the Jeweller looked on it, and told him he would buy it: Well, said he, give me what you will for it; then, quoth he, I will give thee five Crowns
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:199330:72"/> for it; the poor man overjoyed, what! five Crowns said he; the Jeweller thought he spoke Ironically and understood the worth of it, Well, says he, then I will give thee ten Crowns for it, the Seller was silent, and thought he was still mocked; the Jeweller offers then twenty Crowns for it, the man was still astonished, the Buyer comes up to thirty, forty and fifty Crowns; the Seller then begins to think this was a stone of great value and prized it highly (as well he might) at last the Jeweller told him out three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns for it: Home he comes in a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of joy to his Wife, told all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and says, O how grateful, how liberal is the God of the Christians! I lent him fifty Crowns and he has given me three hundred for it; upon this account he turned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and was baptized. But suppose a man shall not meet with such a reward in this life, yet he shall be well paid in the world to come; Christ who cannot lye hath told us, we shall meet with <hi>a recompence at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Just,</hi> and the 25. of <hi>Matthew</hi> gives us sufficient assurance in this particular. I shall not think it unworthy my pains to set down that memorable Narration of <hi>Synesius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Prolemais,</hi> recited by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor This <hi>Synesius</hi> had a friend a Philosopher named <hi>Evagrius,</hi> the Bishop labours his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; he scrupled many things in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:199330:72"/> more especially, could not be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to believe that Promise of receiving a hundred fold for what a man lays out for Christ; <hi>Sinesius</hi> laboured to satisfie him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to become a Christian, and was baptized: After this <hi>Evagrius</hi> brings three hundred pounds to <hi>Sinesius,</hi> and tells him he was willing to give it to the Poor, if <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesius</hi> would be bound for Jesus Christ that he should repay it him in another World, <hi>Sinesius</hi> sets his hand to a Bond and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes Christ should be his Pay-master. After a few years the Philosopher dies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to bury the Bond with him: Three days after the Philosopher appears to <hi>Sinesius,</hi> and bids him take in his Bond, for Christ had given him full satisfaction; they open the Grave, take the Bond, and find at the bottom of it a Confession newly writ as it were with the hand of <hi>Evagrius,</hi> that Christ had fully recompenced him for his 300 pounds. This is also confirmed by <hi>Cedrenus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any shall think these unlikely and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Stories, though reported by men of worth and credit, they may as well quarrel with all Relations and Hear-says: God is marvellous in his works, and often now and then in an Age does some strange and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Acts for the conviction of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous World; but I suppose in the first Times of Christianity such things might be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:199330:73"/> more frequent, and I find Divines of very good note fully perswaded of the Relaters Fidelity in these Commemorations. I could add several other things for the confirmation of this, <hi>viz.</hi> The certainty of a Reward that accompanies Charity in divers other Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as that noted one of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great,<note place="margin">Photii Bibliothec. in excerptis Greg. pag. <hi>484.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Such vain Resolutions are altogether inconsistent with the nature of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for I do not fully correspond with that Definition of Repentance which some give, who say 'tis a hearty sorrow for Sin, though I truly acknowledge that such a kind of Sorrow is an effect, result or concomitant
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:199330:75"/> of Repentance; but Repentance in its true Notion is, a Change of the whole man, when, as the Soul (upon a serious conviction and deliberation) likes the Ways of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as adapted every way to its temporal and eternal Happiness, and upon reasonable Motives dislikes the ways of ungodliness, as destructive every way to its attainable and desired Felicity, and so it takes in all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul; the Understanding judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws of Christ as most rational and equitable, the Will submitting to Christ's Regiment and Sceptre, and owning him as its Lord and Governour, and the Affections in their proper places, shewing themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested and concerned in this holy Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; Love and Desire is no more worldly, carnal, sensual, but holy, spiritual, refined, fixed upon the most excellent Objects of God, Christ, Saints and those unconceivable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which are at God's right hand: Our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is not some worldly misfortune, miss of preferment, a sudden casualty or an accidental disadvantage; but that we have provoked the eyes of the Lord's Jealousie, and have so late entred into the Lord's Vineyard: Our fear is not some frail mortal potent Adversary, a future Disappointment; but we fear him who sits upon the Circle of the Heavens, and whose Kingdom and Supremacy is over all. Thus Repentance and Conversion are synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:199330:75"/> and coincident, and presuppose one and the same thing in Scripture-notion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, &amp;c.</hi> where Repentance and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion have one and the same signification; and if Repentance be such a Change of the whole Soul (as we have declared) then we ought to remember that it is not an instantaneous Act, a work suddenly performed, but a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position requiring long time and serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions; the Understanding must have time to judge and contemplate, the Will consult and ponder before it comply and embrace, and the Assections see complacency in the Object before they exercise their respective Passions: bot how can this be done in so short a space as is oftentimes betwixt sickness and death; the Cunctation of <hi>Fabius</hi> and not the Celerity of <hi>Caesar</hi> is here required. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those that think Conversion can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed suddenly (extraordinary cases except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) must not command my belief; for God usually goes gradually to work in this great Enterprize, and rashness and precipitancy in this case, too often ends in deceit and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.</p>
                  <p>But further, when men pretend to repent at the last or in a time of sickness, I presume 'tis rather an act of Fear than any thing else; for men usually hear and are under Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions even from natural Conscience, that at
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:199330:76"/> the last day of Death a man must play his last Game; they have sentiments and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of appearing before an aweful Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, a severe Majesty, who will require of us an account of our Stewardship, and make us answer to abundance of Interrogatories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our former Conversation; and this startles even the best of men, except God strike in and clear up some special Evidences in this dark night of Dissolution. Now a Sinner coming to meditate of these things, That God will call all before his Throne, that neither the greatness nor meanness of Mortals shall be an Argument for an Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Non-appearance, that 'tis not the Clifts of the Rocks, the depths of the Sea, the vaults of the Earth, or the thickness of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi> can shrowd a man from this Examiner: then great are the thoughts of a mans heart, his lips tremble, his belly quivers and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness is ready to enter into his bones, and he then cries out with the Jaylour, <hi>What shall I do to be saved?</hi> How shall I escape ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting burnings? and then his startled Soul would gladly fall upon something which may keep off feared wrath. Thus 'tis reported of <hi>Galerius,</hi> who had been an enraged Enemy against the Christians; yet at the last, when he was invaded by a verminous Ulcer in his secret parts, which did evaporate so conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and pestilential a smell, that his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:199330:76"/> not being able to endure the Stench thereof, fell down dead before him: he, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending this to be a Judgment of God upon him to retaliate the Tortures he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the innocent Christians, began to relent, gave commandment for the cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Christian Persecution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Equity of divine Justice in these proceedings. But I may say, <hi>Is not the hand of Joab here?</hi> is not this the effect of Fear ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any thing else? Persons in this case and circumstances are like men ready to drown, that catch at every small twig; so now, being ready to drop into the infernal Pit, they fall upon some petty duties of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Contrition. Such are like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who when the rattling Hail and terrible Thunder was abroad, then he called for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> But how much such general acts of Repentance will be accepted I shall not be bold to determine, the Scripture seems to require not a necessitous, but a free and voluntary Service, and would have us not to resemble the Horse and Mule, to whom the Whip and Lash are the only motives and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to obedience.</p>
                  <p>Again, at Death and Sickness men leave not Sin out of choice, but necessity, they are not able to <hi>make provision for the flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof;</hi> the Hand that removed the ancient Land-mark, that smote the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:199330:77"/> secretly, that with <hi>Ephraim</hi> held the Balances of deceit, is now trembling, unact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive and paralytick; the Eyes, that looked upon no other objects but celebrated Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or gazed upon the neighbour's Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and were the Windows of the Soul to let in Sin, are now heavy, dusky, clouded with fumes and vapours, dim with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of approaching Death; the Ears that delighted in Musick and Harmony, Consort and melodious noises, are deaf and unappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, and if he hear any thing, 'tis as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> thought he usually heard sounding in his ears, <hi>Surgite mortui, Arise you dead and come to Judgment;</hi> the Palate, that could so well relish Dainties, taste the generous Wines, that was critical as to Sawces and other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient Appendixes of Riot and Luxury, now has lost the discerning Faculty, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestive Vigour is abated and depraved, and Nature is in such an inverted posture, that what before it earnestly embraced, is now perfectly loathed. The Tongue that uttered the ranting and daring Expressions, now cleavs to the roof of the mouth; and he whose Feet were swift to shed blood, lies like a lame <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth,</hi> so that he is not able to go to his haunts of pleasure, as in the days of Vanity. Now this is not a leaving of Sin, but rather Sin leaves us, because we are not in a capacity to give it entertainment, and our Lusts are like
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:199330:77"/> those that remove from an old crazie falling Cottage, and seek a better Habitation: This parting with sin is not an act of choice and voluntary, but violent, forced and constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from bodily weakness and natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Disease often comes suddenly, and gives no warning, and makes Repentance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; one is swallowed up with a violent Wave, another perishes like the Children of <hi>Job</hi> by a Contignation, a sudden Stab sends another into the Regions of separated Souls;<note place="margin">Plin. natural.

                     <hi>Anacreon</hi> dies by the Kernel of a Grape, <hi>Fabius</hi> by a hair in draught of Milk; some die for joy, as <hi>Chilon</hi> the Lacedemonian when his Son was Victor at the Olympick Games; some by shame and sorrow, as <hi>Diodorus,</hi> not being able to solve a lusory Question: The Legat of <hi>Rhodes</hi> having made a curious Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fell down and expired immediatly, and <hi>Aulus Pompeius</hi> died as he saluted the Gods in the Capitol. Thousands of such Examples may be produced, which plainly show, how that a man that intends to be a future peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent may be prevented. A man thinks on his Death bed to pray and importune Heaven, and a Disease, as an Apoplexy comes, and tyes the Tongue, spoyls the Senses, preys upon the Intellectuals, and with this rapid Torrent men are carryed into the dead Sea, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:199330:78"/> so perish presently, finally, and irrecoverably. Or it may be, if the Disease be not so quick and acute, yet the pains are so strong and violent, that Prayers are turned into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings; a man by increasing dolours is <hi>full of tossings from the time of repose to the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day,</hi> so that when he should send up prayers and supplications, by reason of the predominancy of the Distemper, he makes a wailing like the Dragons, and a mourning like the Owls; with the Shunnamite he cries, <hi>My head, my head,</hi> or with the Prophet, <hi>My bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, my bowels:</hi> O, says he, <hi>Is there no Balm in Gilead?</hi> Is there no Physician can prescribe a Remedy? <hi>Was there ever any sorrow like to my sorrow? I am the man that has seen afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all thy waves and storms have gone over me;</hi> and as he is not fit at this time to discourse concerning Bargains, sealing of Contracts and Evidences, so 'tis not a fit time to <hi>give diligence to make calling and election sure,</hi> or to strike a Covenant with the holy One of Israel: All that a man can do then is only to have some slight desires, transient wishes with <hi>Balaam,</hi> bemoaning Ejaculations, and those take up the little time usually we have till Death close our Lips with silence, and put a period to Life and Motion. Therefore Christian, whosoever thou art that readest these Lines, be not so unwise as to neglect the season of Grace and time of Visitation, profered oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:199330:78"/> with vain hopes that these great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements shall be done when thy days hasten to a Conclusion and Death approaches. Alas! this Destroyer comes unawares often, marches furiously like <hi>Jehu</hi> the Son of <hi>Nimshi,</hi> gives no warning, sends no summons, uses no Capitulations; but like a violent Hurrican throws down these Clay-cottages: So that a man postes away into the Confines of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and is at Heaven's Tribunal, when (it may be with the Fool) he thought to have spun out many years upon the Stage of the Earth. Now therefore fall upon the great Duties of Faith and Repentance, mortifie thy Lusts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon thy sinful Associates, hoise up Sail for the Haven of eternal Rest; give no sleep; to thy Eyes, nor rest to the Temples of thy Head, till thou be reconciled to God through the Blood of Jesus: <hi>Go and take words to thy self and say, Turn thou me and I shall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; take away all mine iniquity and receive me graciously; remove my sins as a thick cloud from before thy face, and do not, O Lord, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute against me the fierceness of thy wrath, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther return to destroy me, because thou art God and not man.</hi> Plead the Satisfaction of Christ, the Merits of the great Reconciler, the kind deportment of the Father to the dissolute Prodigal, and leave not wrestling, with <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> till thou obtain a blessing: Let these things be first heeded and timely regarded,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:199330:79"/> lest thy Sun do set suddenly and thou lie down in sorrow, and shalt be forced in the infernal Vault to wish, <hi>O mihi praeteritos, &amp;c.

                  <p>Though this I will add in the last place, I will not say whatsoever the Sinner does on his Death-bed is useless and insignificant (as I am not for Origenian Fancies, as that there is so much Mercy in God that he will be kind to the Devils after certain Periods of Time, so no more do I desire to speak of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalness of God's Vindictive Justice;) <hi>For who has known the mind of God, or who hath been his counseller? his mercy reacheth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and is like the great Deep bottomless and unfathomable; only according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we cannot promise Happiness and a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the Second Death where there has
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:199330:79"/> not been a holy Life preceeding, and the practice of Christ's Institutions; only that God who has set Laws to the reasonable Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, may dispense with them or put them into execution as he pleases. And the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents (except those that were of the Novatian way) were very charitable when they saw men repent at the last,<note place="margin">Nec serum est quod verum, nec irremis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile quod volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium &amp; quaecunque necessitas cogat ad poenitudinem, nec quantitas criminis, nec brevitas tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, nec horae extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas, nec vitae e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normitas, (si vera contritio, si pura fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit voluptatum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio) excludit à ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niâ, <hi>Cyprian. lib. de Coen.

Therefore if there be any that <hi>in extremis,</hi> at or near the hour of his departure, is much grieved for his sin and trespasses, and with the Ninivites <hi>cries mightily to God,</hi> and importunes with more than ordinary ardency the favour of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God, far be it from me (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this) to rank him among the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; neither according to the Rules of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or the nature of Repentance, dare I say he is certainly saved, but shall wave all definitive Sentences in this particular, desiring
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:199330:80"/> every good Christian to mind the time of his own Visitation, and leave such an one to stand or fall to his own master.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Another Vain Tradition is, That when a man begins to be Religious then he grows melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;</hi> he must bid adieu to all his pleasures and contentments, lead a doleful and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate life, like <hi>the Owl in the desart or the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican in the wilderness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is a notorious Falshood, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does not hinder our joy and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for it bids us <hi>rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of our salvation,</hi> and one of the fruits of the Spirit is Joy, and Peace, which usually are a Believer's concomitants. 'Tis true indeed Religion limits that carnal Joy, those sensual Pleasures, those unlawful dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Soul, but sober refined mirth and gladness it promotes and furthers; and what is there no joy but what proceeds from Masks and Balls, from Riot and Luxury, from midnight Revels and profuse Banquettings? Is there no pleasure but what <hi>Epicurus</hi> likes, as Wine and wanton Dalliance, curious Dishes, generous Liquour, jovial Company? Yes surely, there be intellectual Joys which are fit for Souls and spiritual Essences, which are much more sprightly and vigorous than these faint and short-lived Comforts which arise from Lust and Sensuality. Does not a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher take more satisfaction, as a Platonist
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:199330:80"/> in his <hi>Ideas</hi> and Speculations, and <hi>Archimedes</hi> in his Mathematical Rarities, than ever <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus, Philoxenus, Anacreon</hi> did in their Bowls of Wine, Beds of Roses, multitudes of Concubines, and such like corporeal Delights? A contemplative Athenian has a more lasting Joy than a delicate Sybarite, and he would not quit his speculative Solaces, for the blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishings of Sense, the Musical Airs, and the embraces of <hi>Venus,</hi> which the more dissolute Grecian prizes and extols: So a Christian, he can meditate upon the Divine Majesty toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his glorious Attributes, his Acts of Omnipotency, his providential Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his superexcellent Goodness, his exact Justice; he can with the longing Angels pry into the Mystery of Redemption, and behold the depths of God's Love and Wisdom, the Emanations of his Grace and bounty, the sweet Contrivances of Heaven in order to the saving of sinking Mortals: He can meditate upon the excellency of Commands, the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Promises, the strictness of Threats, the Sabbatical Rest and the pleasures of Eternity, which the Epicurean Sect never comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; here he can please himself and recreate his comprehensive Soul; these are <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> when these earthly pleasures are gross and feculent, which the Soul looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Husks and courser fare, in respect of these Viands of Rational and Noetical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:199330:81"/> these are the Garlick and Onyons in respect of these spiritual and Angelical dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>That a Christian is a joyful man, let us first consider, who is it that can chearfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself in a cloudy day? Let a disaster happen to a carnal Worldling, he hangs down his head like unto a Bulrush, he grows faint and pale, pensive and melancholy, like a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed <hi>Ahab</hi> when he could not have <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s Vineyard; but the Servant of God is lively and joyful under the greatest pressures. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knows that bonds and afflictions abide him at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but he matters not; the perils of the Sea, the perils of Robbers, Shipwracks and Conspiracies all tend to make him miserable, but his vigorous Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns and triumphs over them: These are the Eagles that confront Tempests and Thunders, Storms and Commotions; Come, says <hi>Luther,</hi> when all went wrong and he heard of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous contrivances against the Church, <hi>let us sing the</hi> 46. Psalm, <hi>The Lord of hosts is with us and the God of Jacob is our refuge. Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> sung in the prison, and <hi>Hawkes</hi> clapt his hands in the flames. Wicked men are like the sensible Plant, which, if touched by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal force, contracts its leaves and shrinks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably; so let them be touched with some casual disaster, their <hi>Musick is turned into howling; and their organ into the voice of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:199330:81"/> them that weep,</hi> but a true Christian can lift up his head with joy, sing like the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, though thorns be at her breast, <hi>si fractus illabatur orbis, if nature be inverted, and the pillars of the earth tremble, if the fig-tree do not blossom, and there be not fruit in the vine,</hi>

                  <p>Who is it also that can be merry at death? take the Gallant that has gratified his Lusts, that has crowned himself with Rose-buds, that has ransack'd the Creation to please his luxurious Appetite; let Death come, then he shrugs and trembles, his guilty soul dreads an arrest, and nothing is so dismal and ominous as an approaching dissolution; then you shall see a <hi>Saul</hi> aghast and dispirited, when he is told by the Phantasm, raised up by the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> that he shall cease to be; this is as the <hi>Mene-Tekel</hi> to <hi>Belshazar</hi> which makes the Joynts of his Loins to be loosed, and his Knees to smite one against another; but to a Saint of God the thoughts of his departure are not troublesome and vexatious, he kindly entertains this Angel of death, as <hi>Lot</hi> those that came to <hi>Sodom; though I walk,</hi> sayes <hi>David, through the Region of the Valley of Death, yet will I fear no ill; Moses</hi> never mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered when God said go to Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> and

                  <p>But further the true Christian has cause to rejoyce, if we consider a fourfold advantage that he has above the wicked and prophane, <hi>viz.</hi> he has the smile of God, the sweet of the promises, the sealings of the Spirit, and the solaces of a good conscience.</p>

                  <p>Now the World in order to the ensnaring of us, presents these two Objections against the practice of Religion: 1. It tells us that if we make Religion our business, we shall be but poor, low, indigent, and fall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and infamy; it is wealth gains men credit and respect, and sets them up above the Vulgar: To this I answer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is an untruth to say that all religious persons are poor and meanly provided for in the World; God is pleased to give to many
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:199330:87"/> of his servants the dew of Heaven, and the fat of the Earth, the blessings of the upper and of the nether Springs: What should I tell you of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Heards, of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Flocks, of <hi>Isaack</hi>'s Hundred fold in the Land of <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> the most righteous and most rich man in the Land of <hi>Ʋz;</hi> and I doubt not but that <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Dorcas, Gaius,</hi> and <hi>Onesyphorus</hi> whose charity and communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Saints was so remarkable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary, had a good share of these earthly enjoyments; we can produce many holy men that have had Vines and Fig-trees, numerous Flocks and Cattle upon the Mountains, whose Valleys did laugh and sing, and whose Presses did overflow with Wine, and have had that confluence of temporal blessings, that men with <hi>Balaam</hi> have been ready to say, <hi>How goodly are thy Tents O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and thy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles O</hi> Israel? <hi>As Gardens by the River sides, as Trees of Lign-Aloes which the Lord hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Cedar trees besides the Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides (suppose thou shouldest be poor) was not Christ and other brave men in the same condition? the blessed Jesus came not into the World as a secular Prince, shining with Pearls, glittering with Silks, overlay'd with Gold, and hemm'd in with a croud of attending servants; he had no stately Palace, no curious Viands, no musical Consorts, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>Arabia</hi> wherewith to perfume his

                  <p>Again, God keeps many a Saint sharp, for excellent and advantagious ends; fulness and plenty oftentimes usher in neglect of God, and security: when <hi>Jeshurun</hi> is fed to the full, then he lifts up his heel against his Master; and we are ready to slight Heaven, to pitch our tents on this side <hi>Jordan;</hi> supposing <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> and <hi>Gilead</hi> to be more commodious, than the Land of Promise. Therefore God gives Meat to satisfie Hunger, not to gratifie thy Curiosity; Drink to quench Thirst, and not to please thy affected Palate; Cloaths to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy Nakedness, and not to be Promoters of Pride and Vanity. If thou hadst plenty, (ten to one) thou wouldst begin to Epicurize, to wax fat, to forget the God that made thee, and to neglect the Rock of thy Salvation, therefore God doth moderately dyet thee, that thou maist not grow a wanton Sodomite, or a lazy Sidonian; but an abstemious Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kabite, and temperate Christian: and so maist be more fit for the service of him that gave thee a Being, and sent thee to labour in his Vineyard. To this purpose the story of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logius</hi> is remarkable, in the days of <hi>Justinus,</hi> about the Year, 528. He was a Stone-cutter in <hi>Thebais,</hi>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:199330:89"/> the Hermite was very importunate with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that he would make <hi>Eulogius</hi> a rich man; which was granted: And upon a time, as <hi>Eulogius</hi> was digging stones, he found a great Treasure. After this, he leaves his Trade, and goes to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and in process of time, gets to be Captain of the Guard to <hi>Justinus:</hi> There he addicts himself to all Riot and Luxury. The Hermite was commanded by God to go to him, and to see if he could reform him: Away he goes to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and after a long and a tedious attendance, speaks with him; but was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with blows for his admonitions. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Justinus</hi> dies, and <hi>Justinian</hi> succeeds; <hi>Hypatius</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> raise a Conspiracy against the new Emperour: <hi>Eulogius</hi> takes their part; but at last they were all conquered, so that <hi>Eulogius</hi> was glad to run for his life; and all his Goods were confiscated: He retires to <hi>Thebais</hi> again; and being in great Poverty, falls to his old Trade: The Hermite comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to him, and found him cool, more mild and patient, than he was at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> He intreats the Hermite, once more to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore God for an amendment of his Estate: The Hermite refuses, and tells him, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saw Poverty was the fittest condition for him; for if it were otherwise with him, he would suddenly fall into his old Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Debauchery.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:199330:89"/>
                  <p>But further, Another reason why God gives many of his people mean Enjoyments here, is to endear Heaven to them, and to make them willing, quietly to depart from this Vale of misery. A man of pleasure cleaves to the World, as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi;</hi> there is a sad part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt them, a passionate farewell, to bid adieu to rich Mannours, delicate, fair, numerous Attendants, stately Palaces: <hi>Haec sunt quae fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Whereas the Christian that has been kept mean and low here, patiently retires and layes down this earthly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, knowing that he has been only a Sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and a Pilgrim, that he never was For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes Favourite, or the World's Darling, and so he lies down in hope and expectation of better Enjoyments than he has met with in his Pilgrimage her below.</p>
                  <p>And it may be remembred how pleasant will Heaven be to the afflicted Christian, like Sun-shine after Rain, like the desirable Port to the weather beaten Ship, like the Father's House to the wearied Prodigal, like the Wells and Palm-trees at <hi>Elim,</hi> like the clefts of the Rocks and the secret places of the stairs to the pursued Dove: O how will the soul be transported, to exchange a poor Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the glorious <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> ragged gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for robes of glory, a sheep-hook for a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:199330:90"/> Scepter, waters of <hi>Marah</hi> for the fountain of life, Vultures and birds of prey (bad Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) for an Angelical Retinue, Mournings and Threnodies for Songs of <hi>Sion:</hi> O the extasie of such a soul! will it not cry out with <hi>Esau, I have enough, come unto me all ye that fear God and I will tell you what he hath done for my soul;</hi> therefore Christian do not thou shrug at affliction and poverty, or the dayes of adversity, at cross dispensations, and mean treatment in the World; others have been in the same circumstances with thee, and ere long thou shalt be better accommodated, therefore close up thy lips with silence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise contentation.</p>
                  <p>But the World objects to Christians in the second place, and says, what my Favourites have, is in fruition; but the Riches and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which you are likely to have, are only in expectation; and 'tis good to be sure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We answer, Christians have not all Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but we have part in hand: God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for Belivers Meat to eat, and Rayment to put on; and feeds them as <hi>Agur</hi> prayed, with food convenient for them. Is <hi>Eliah</hi> glad to flee? A Raven, though an indocible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, shall bring him meat. Is <hi>Israel</hi> in straits? rather than they shall starve, Manna and Quails shall descend from Heaven upon them; and the stony Rock shall send forth Streams
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:199330:90"/> in a parched Wilderness. Rather than <hi>Lot</hi> shall perish, God will provide a <hi>Zoar</hi> for him. The Meal in the Barrel, and the Oyl in the Cruse, shall be miraculously multiplyed to the Woman of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> till there be plenty in <hi>Israel.</hi> God raises up his people many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected friends, and they have unhoped and unlooked for Provisions. We read of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> that he was brought to those straits, that he was glad to joyn himself to a Weaver, and work with him, for the support of his indigent Family; but they not agreeing in their Principles, the Weaver turn'd him off; not knowing what course to take, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Town-ditch of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> was to be scoured, and many Labourers there em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; thither he goes, intending to fall upon that work; but Providence so ordered it, that <hi>Buser</hi> was acquainted with his arrival; and a Church falling void in the Town, he was called by the Magistrates, to be the Preacher, and so had a comfortable subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But the most famous Narrative that I have met with in confirmation of this, is the History of Mr. <hi>John Craig</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:199330:99"/> Mountain, or throw it into the Sea: God can calm, he can make a Lyon a Lamb, a Vulture a Dove, he can put a hook in the nose of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and make <hi>Behemoth</hi> tame and flexible; God, <hi>is that cunning Lapidary that,</hi> can make a rugged Stone a curious Gem, <hi>Laban</hi> thought to have done great things to <hi>Jacob,</hi> but God met him by the way, superseded his passions, and gave a charge to him to speak to <hi>Jacob</hi> neither good nor bad; <hi>Israel</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Persian</hi> as well as the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, would have hindred their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Holy Land, when lo a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree comes from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove with an Olive-branch) and gives leave to re-edifie the Temple, and then were the Vessels of the Sanctuary restored, and thus the Mountain in <hi>Zachariah</hi> became a plain in the way of <hi>Zerubbabel; Saul</hi> was by nature hot and fiery, consenting to the death of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> one that made it his business to keep down growing Christianity, but God met him in the way to <hi>Damascus,</hi> humbled him, took away (as I may say) his Commission, gave him a new patent, and made him an Apostle of the Gentiles; and now behold a change, he that was a persecutor is now a preacher; he that anathematized Christians, now preaches peace by Jesus Christ; he that was as the wilde Boar of the Forrest, fiery and raging, is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:199330:100"/> now like his new Master, meek and lowly; he that was an ominous and portentous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, now sends out sweet, heavenly and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Influences, who but Saint <hi>Paul?</hi> Now the weapons of his warfare are not carnal, but mighty and spiritual; he is not harassing the Christians, but fighting against principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers; he is not beating the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, but beating down his own body and bringing it into subjection, and captivating every thing to the obedience of Jesus Christ; he that vomited out flames and fury, comes as a peaceable Ambassadour, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him the ministry of Reconciliation, and entreating men for Christ's sake to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God: Whereby we see what God can do, the power of Divinity, and the operations of an Omnipotent Agent, God has a hammer for an adamantine heart, and can make a flinty soul flexible, and receive the divine signatures and impressions: Thus God sweetned <hi>Trajan</hi> who stirred up the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, and stilled his rage upon the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>Plinius Secundus;</hi> and <hi>Aurelian</hi> being about to sign an Edict against the Christians, God hindred his purpose by cramping his knuckles, and by the fall of a Thunderbolt which had like to have slain him; therefore Christian, wait patiently, God can calm the passions of men, and smooth their rough and uuhewen natures; so that thou shalt see a

                  <p>But if a persecutor will not melt with a beam, God can crush him with a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, if he will not be moved with soft per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, with a compassionate <hi>Suada,</hi> God can ruine him with a revenging <hi>Nemesis;</hi> he can pour a viol of wrath upon the Sun, throw down Crowns and Scepters, humble the greatest Monarchs of the Earth, and let them know they are but worms and dust in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the lofty one that inhabits eternity: How many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours came to untimely ends after they had been so vexatious to the Christians?<note place="margin">Seventy three pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the space of an hundred years, whereof only three dyed a natural death.</note>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:199330:103"/> the World, and as we embrace the old and the new Testament, both of them had such a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn confirmation from Heaven, as no other obtruded Religion can glory in; 'tis true the ancient Legislators pretended a divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from some particular Deities, but this was, <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> they never proved their assertions by extraordinary acts; you hear of no Miracles wrought by <hi>Egeria, Apollo, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> or <hi>Minerva</hi> for the ratification of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, like those the two Testaments can produce; with what pomp and stateliness was the Law delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> thund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and lightnings, the Mount smoaking and quaking, <hi>When God came from Teman,</hi>

A thing to which the Jews were used under the second Temple; did not the unclean spirits unanimously confess him to be the Son of God? Did not his repeated Miracles evidence a Divine Mission? Such <hi>as the raising of the dead, opening the blind eyes, dispossessing Divels,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:199330:103"/> and curing Diseases,</hi> which could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by humane remedies; these were other kind of things than the Heathenish wonders, such as cutting a whet-stone, fetching water in a Sieve, drawing a Ship with a Girdle, and the pranks of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> which might be done by the agency of Spirits or Demons; which Miracles of Christ were so remarkable, that <hi>Pilate</hi> sent a Catalogue of them to <hi>Tyberius,</hi> and he was earnest with the Senate at <hi>Rome</hi> for the deifying of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: Did not at the same <hi>Oracles</hi> begin to fail? the Idols of <hi>Egypt</hi> vanish? the Statues of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Quirinus</hi> fall? and though <hi>Julian</hi> after would have consulted the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Daphne</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Antioch,</hi>

               <p>Are not these Demonstrations of the truth and excellency of our Religion; Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be matched either by Gentile, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or any other that have pretended receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dictates from above, for the ordering and regulating the communities of men?</p>
               <p>But again the excellency of our Religion appears as it is a rational Religion, suting with those faculties which the Supreme Moderator has bestowed upon us, and so is most fit both for the governing the private conversations
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:199330:104"/> of men, and the more publick Societies of the World; some Religions are ridiculous, as granting Polytheism or multitudes of Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, conniving at sins, having such notions of God as are unbecoming so sacred a Majesty, enjoyning such fooleries as are fitter to be laught out of the World than command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and thus many toyes in Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lism I suppose of old were derided by <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and some other more knowing <hi>Athenians.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. But in the second place, our Religion as reformed is most excellent, of which we may easily be convinced, because of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity which it has with the holy Scriptures. For let us take either the Greek or the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, and we shall find, that though they own the Christian Religion in general, yet they have abundance of Observances and some dogmatical Points also, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Canon of the holy Writ. The Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians equalize Traditions with the Scriptures, affirm that the holy Ghost proceeds not from the Son; that the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> except <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis</hi> are not to be read; that Christ is the only Mediatour of Redemption, but not of Intercession, they also swear by the Cross. The Armenians are partly of the Eutichyan Heresie, which seemed to make a Coalition of the Two Natures of Christ into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Nature; they give the Eucharist to Infants; they count several Beasts unclean, and have inserted several things into their Creeds not ordinarily maintained either by the Greek or Latin Churches. The Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites hold that there is in Christ but one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Will and Operation, imprint on their Children before Baptism the mark of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:199330:105"/> Cross with an hot Iron; they say that Angels are made of Fire and Light, and that the Souls of men remain in the Earth till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. The Abyssines use Circumcision, abstain from several Beasts as unclean, keep the Sabboth and the Lord's day both alike, receive the Wine in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in a Spoon, and must not spit that day they take it; they hold traduction of Souls, and admit of painted Images. The like we might shew of the <hi>Cophti,</hi> the <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> and <hi>Melchites,</hi> and others in those Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Countries, who have introduced things never so much as hinted in the blessed Gospel. And if we come to the Roman Church, we shall find it asserting <hi>Apochrypha</hi> for Canonical Scripture, the Pope's Supremacy, Invocation of Saints, Adoration of Images, Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, Latin Service, Indulgences, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Extreme Unction, Monastick Vows, Traditions (and such like) which have no warrant from the divine Records, but are the Doctrines of men, and the Divination of their own Brains, sympathizing with their predecessors the Pharisees, who brought in abundance of usages and observances, never prescribed of God in the Mount to <hi>Moses;</hi> so neither were these ever made authentick by Jesus Christ, the <hi>Basis</hi> of which Doctrines being only humane Authority; and so they may pass as the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> the

If you would not waver, then labour to get the Grace of Patience; for this is an excellent qualification of a Christian in order to the settlement of him in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Impatience makes men fret and give up the cause, especially if the weather be bad, the way foul and Religion under the hatches. <hi>What shall I wait for the Lord any longer,</hi> says the King of Israel, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. When there was a Famine in <hi>Samaria,</hi> he was the very next door to Atheism; when the gourd was gone, and the parching Sun beat upon the head of <hi>Jonah,</hi> O how peevish &amp; intemperate was he! and the potsheard was ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with the Potter; So it is in the practice of Christianty, when as the Doctrine of the Cross comes to be managed, resisting to blood and losing all for Christ's sake, it makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny give over, then they say with the Slugg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, <hi>There is a Lion in the way;</hi> when the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:199330:109"/> winds whistle, and the waves rise, and ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack likely to happen, then they begin to say, O that we had not taken this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Voyage, O that we were on shoar again; what is there never a more safe passage than this dangerous Irish Ocean? The impatient Christian says, what is this my Portion for my fear of God, and love to Christ? I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Roses and Lilies, and behold a Crown of Thorns, I hoped for Sun-shines and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonian-days, but I fail of my expectations; I see I do nothing but encounter difficulties, and grapple with disasters which like succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waves do overtake each other; will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing serve but my blood? must my Estate be confiscated, and I with <hi>Job</hi> made poor to a Proverb, <hi>Wo is me that I am constrained to dwell in</hi> Meshech, <hi>and to have my habitation in the Tents of</hi> Kedar; wo is me that with <hi>Symon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> I am compelled to take up this burdensom Cross, and to have my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed in <hi>Golgatha,</hi> to be a Spectacle to the World, to Angels, and Men: And thus the Christian is ready to throw down his arms, quit the field, and turn Renegado. But when the God of Patience infuses this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue into the Soul, it calms men's spirits, stills the passions, cools the heats, and allays the storms and commotions we are incident to; it makes men flexible and submissive to all the acts of Divine Providence; it makes a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:199330:110"/> man to be dumb with <hi>David,</hi> or to say with <hi>Ely, It is the Lord, let him do what seems good in his eyes.</hi> Thus our blessed Saviour, that great Pattern and Exemplar of Patience, spake very little at his arraignment before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> but fulfilled the Prophecy, <hi>He went as an Ox to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before the Shearer is dumb, so he openend not his mouth.</hi> And he bids us <hi>in Patience, possess our souls,</hi>

Now the Soul of man may be compared to the unsettled waves, till Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence come which allays the unquiet passions, fixes the turbulent humours, and puts the whole Soul into a sedate &amp; peaceable temper, so that he that was like an angry Lion ready to tear himself, and the Author of his Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

               <p>When <hi>Israel</hi> came to <hi>Marah,</hi> they could not drink of the Waters because they were bitter, but <hi>Moses</hi> by the Divine appointment, put a certain Wood into them, which made them sweet and potable: So we meet here with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a bitter draught and brackish Potion, like to our Saviour's Cup that was mingled with Gall &amp; Vineger, but Patience sweetens them, and so we take them off; it takes away the Acrimony and sharpness of these unpleasing Liquors, and makes them (though disastful) yet Medicinal. How did the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians bear up both against the reproaches and persecutions that befel them? They were called <hi>Pisciculi, Fishes,</hi> not only from the first Letters of the Sybilline riddle, but because of their going into the Water when they were baptized; when they celebrated the Lord's Supper, and took Bread and Wine according to his Institution, they were called Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres;</hi> their Night-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships were called Revellings and Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet they regarded not reproaches and calumnies; bonds and burdens, fire and faggots, the rage of Men and fury of Devils, Patience made them still, and was as cool water to allay the heat and inflammation of this fiery Tryal. How remarkable was the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:199330:111"/> last act of <hi>Polycarp!</hi> he feasted the men that came to apprehend him, and gave them good chear, and when they brought him to the stake, he quietly said, Let me alone, you need not nail or fasten me, for he that brought me hither will give me patience to endure these Torments. <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not rail against his Adversaries when they were ready to throw him to wild Beasts, but said, I care neither for things visible or invisible, so I may gain Christ. When <hi>Galienus Maximus</hi> sent for St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and read the Sentence of his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which was that he should be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he patiently said Amen, let it be so, put of his cloths, gave the Executioner the little gold and money that he had, and submitted his neck to the stroke of the sword. And the same St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us a story of one of his Presbyters of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:199330:111"/> piece of patience was that of the Theban Legion in the days of <hi>Maximian,</hi> who because they would not sacrifice to false gods, he put them to a decimation, causing every tenth man to be murdered, then again commands the rest to sacrifice, who refusing as before, are all immediatly put to the sword with <hi>Mauritius</hi> their Colonel, not in the least making any resistance upon the account of self-preservation. Thus we see how patience had her perfect work, and thus still will have the same effect upon genuine Christians, it will make them speak such language as this; 'Tis true the sky is lowring and the Heavens frown, <hi>Ishmaels</hi> scoff and <hi>Nimrods</hi> persecute, but we must endure and put up affronts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are Strangers and Pilgrims as all our Fathers were; yet a little while and the Sun will show his clouded head, the shadows will disappear, the spring will put in, the course will be over, and we shall reach the Goal; then shall the tired Horse be disburdened, and the weary Ox repose himself in his Master's stall; <hi>he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry;</hi> they are ready to say to God as the Slave of <hi>Antistenes</hi> to his Master, <hi>Nullus bacculus tam durus, &amp;c.

But the Christian that is furnished with the grace of patience puts up injuries and misu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, and takes all dispensations in good part, as proceeding from the great Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouler of all things. Excellent was that speech of <hi>Anna Boullen</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her death, she thanked him that he had made her from a private Gentle-woman, a Marquess, from a Marquess a Queen, and so a Martyr.

'Tis said of one <hi>Andreas,</hi> a King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> that he bound himself by Oath to go to the Holy War, but he went and bathed himself only in a River not far from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and so returned: but let it not be enough for thee to do some small ceremonious acts, and trifles in Religion, but heartily espouse the whole Cause of God, &amp; contend for that Doctrine of Faith.

And how careful the Heathens were in performing the things they had covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might be showed at large: Do not thou therefore deny that Faith which thou hast owned and approved, that Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> to whom thou hast promised Allegiance, lest <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> the Africans and Romans, and all the Heathens rise up against thee and condemn thee before God, Angels, and Men for Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Apostacy, and so thou have a more severe punishment and a larger vial of wrath than ordinary Criminals.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, To <hi>hold fast your profession;</hi> And to this purpose think often of the doom of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates, and of the glory of overcoming Saints. Seldom has a man turned a Renegado but a Divine Vengeance hath pursued him; God has marked such with his Judgments like <hi>Cain,</hi> and with <hi>Ʋzziah</hi> they have carried their punishments in their forehead; those that with <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife have looked back, God has made them formidable Examples of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Severity to future Ages; the fate of <hi>Julian</hi> was mentioned before, and 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to transcribe the story of <hi>Spira,</hi> who after his revolt to the Romish party, dyed blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming under such horrid desperation that it cannot be paralell'd.

But the most remarkable punishment of backsliders is recorded by <hi>Luther,</hi> whose words I shall not think amiss to transcribe: <hi>Albertus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ments,</hi> had a Physician attending upon him, who was a Protestant, this man in hope of more gain and favour fell to the Romish Religion, &amp; used such words as these, I will for a while set Christ behind the door till I be rich, and then I will take him again; but that very Night he was found in his bed with his tongue torn out of his mouth, as black as any coal, &amp; his neck wrung in twain in a most fearful manner; I my self, saith <hi>Luther,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Frankfurt</hi> to <hi>Ments,</hi>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:199330:120"/> that the Thunder may destroy me; even the same day happened a fearful Tempest of Thunder and Lightning, he calling his words to mind ran to the Church, and caused the bells to be rung, thereby to drive the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest over, and kneeling before the Altar he was struck by the Tempest into a trance or swoon, after they had cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him and refreshed him,<note place="margin">Luth. ibid. p. <hi>413.</hi>

Here was a most prodigious punishment for Apostacy: but alas! what are those temporal woes to that future wrath to be revealed. Let us read S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Jude,</hi> where for such (we are told) is reserved the blackness of darkness, that their damnation slumbereth not, that <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Legions must be Confederates with these <hi>Demasses,</hi> who must all, as joynt Copartners in sin, be thrown down into the dark Abysses of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting wo; Then shall they wail and lament their folly and prevarication, that they for-fook the Fountain of Living Water, and trampled under foot the Pearls of Salvation; that they sleighted Christ for <hi>Mammon,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Sodom</hi> before <hi>Jer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:199330:121"/> of a persecuting <hi>Furio,</hi> that refused to strike sail to the humours of men, or worship the golden Image, but owned my Truth in those dayes when such as <hi>Antipas</hi> were my faithful Martyrs: Therefore well done, good and faithful Servants, enter into Joy and rest from your Labours, come and sit under my shadow with great delight, behold here be pleasures to counterpoise your woes and dolours, here be Crowns &amp; Robes, Smiles &amp; Embraces, for racks and Gibbets, for Fire and Faggot, for threats and persecutions; now take the Timbrel, and Harp, and Vial, and utter your Songs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and victory; Heaven is before you, and the delights thereof are yours; solace your selves in everlasting Bliss and let your Cups overflow, now receive the fruit of your Faith and Constancy, the sweets of the Promises and the rewards of your perseverance. This shall be the Language of the blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Christians, after which shall follow an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture with all the Privileges of the Saints in Light, a sweet Reposal in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom, a tasting how good the Lord is, eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and satisfaction. This is the Heritage of the Servants of the Lord, and their portion from the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
